/**
 * This class is used to wrap a native handle used with JNI and guard access to a native object that
 * the native handle represents.
 * NativeHandle attempts to enforce the following assumptions:
 * 1) Native calls to the same native object cannot be made concurrently from multiple threads.
 * 2) Native handle cannot be resolved (and the underlying native object can't be destroyed) while it
 *    is used in an ongoing native call.
 * 3) Native handle cannot be used after it has been resolved.
 *
 * <p>Creating native object and storing the handle:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * nativeHandle = new NativeHandle(createNativeObjectXyz());
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Making native call requires acquiring the handle in order to get the
 * underlying handle value:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (NativeHandle.ScopedHandle scopedHandle = nativeHandle.acquire()) {
 *   callNativeMethodXyz(scopedHandle.get());
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Destroying native object requires acquiring the handle too and releasing the underlying
 * handle value:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (NativeHandle.ScopedHandle scopedHandle = nativeHandle.acquire()) {
 *   destroyNativeObjectXyz(scopedHandle.release());
 * }
 * }</pre>
