"""An example of program logic to use in a federated program.

The program logic is abstracted into a separate function to illustrate the
boundary between the program and the program logic. Note the Python types of the
function signature, this program logic only depends on the abstract interfaces
defined by the TFF's federated program API and does not depend and the platform,
therefore this program logic is portable across platforms.

  """Trains a federated model for some number of rounds.

  The following `tff.Computation` types signatures are required:

  *   `initialize`: `( -> state)`.
  *   `train`:      `(<state, client_data> -> <state, metrics>)`
  *   `evaluation`: `(<state, client_data> -> metrics)`

  This function invokes `initialize` to construct a local `state` and then runs
  `total_rounds` rounds updating this `state`. At each round, this update occurs
  by invoking `train` with the `state` and the `client_data` selected from the
  `train_data_source`. Each round, the training metrics are released to the
  `train_output_managers` and the updated `state` used in the next round of
  training.

  *   Round 0 represents the initialized state
  *   Round 1 through `total_rounds` represent the training rounds

  After training, this function invokes `evaluation` once with the updated
  `state` and the `client_data` selected from the `evaluation_data_source`; and
  the evaluation metrics are released to the `evaluation_output_managers`.

  Finally, `state` is released to the `model_output_manager`.

  Args:
    initialize: A `tff.Computation` to invoke before training.
    train: A `tff.Computation` to invoke during training.
    train_data_source: A `tff.program.FederatedDataSource` which returns client
      data used during training.
    evaluation: A `tff.Computation` to invoke to evaluate the model produced
      after training.
    evaluation_data_source: A `tff.program.FederatedDataSource` which returns
      client data used during evaluation.
    total_rounds: The number of training rounds to run.
    number_of_clients: The number of clients per round of training.
    train_output_managers: An optional list of `tff.program.ReleaseManager`s
      used to release training output.
    evaluation_output_managers: An optional list of
      `tff.program.ReleaseManager`s used to release evaluation output.
    model_output_manager: An optional `tff.program.ReleaseManager` used to
      release training output.
    program_state_manager: An optional `tff.program.ProgramStateManager` used to
      save program state for fault tolerance.
