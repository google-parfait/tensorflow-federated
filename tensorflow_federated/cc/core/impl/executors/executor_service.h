// `Compute` is the single method below which can block at the application
// layer. It serves as a signal from the client that values need to be
// materialized on the other side of the gRPC channel.
//
// The methods `SetCardinalities` and `ClearExecutor` can be thought of as
// executor-stack state management. `SetCardinalities` must be called before the
// service can serve `Create` or `Compute` requests, as the results of some
// computations can depend on the cardinalities hosted by this executor stack.
// `ClearExecutor` can be used to reset the stack, IE, reset the internal
// executor to null.
//
// Finally, `Dispose` serves as an explicit resource-management request;
// `Dispose` serves to inform the service that it can free any resources
// associated to the values which the `Dispose` request specified.
