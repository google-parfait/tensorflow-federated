  """Loads the Federated EMNIST dataset.

  Downloads and caches the dataset locally. If previously downloaded, tries to
  load the dataset from cache.

  This dataset is derived from the Leaf repository
  (https://github.com/TalwalkarLab/leaf) pre-processing of the Extended MNIST
  dataset, grouping examples by writer. Details about Leaf were published in
  "LEAF: A Benchmark for Federated Settings" https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01097.

  *Note*: This dataset does not include some additional preprocessing that
  MNIST includes, such as size-normalization and centering.
  In the Federated EMNIST data, the value of 1.0
  corresponds to the background, and 0.0 corresponds to the color of the digits
  themselves; this is the *inverse* of some MNIST representations,
  e.g. in [tensorflow_datasets]
  (https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/blob/master/docs/datasets.md#mnist),
  where 0 corresponds to the background color, and 255 represents the color of
  the digit.

  Data set sizes:

  *only_digits=True*: 3,383 users, 10 label classes

  -   train: 341,873 examples
  -   test: 40,832 examples

  *only_digits=False*: 3,400 users, 62 label classes

  -   train: 671,585 examples
  -   test: 77,483 examples

  Rather than holding out specific users, each user's examples are split across
  _train_ and _test_ so that all users have at least one example in _train_ and
  one example in _test_. Writers that had less than 2 examples are excluded from
  the data set.

  The `tf.data.Datasets` returned by
  `tff.simulation.datasets.ClientData.create_tf_dataset_for_client` will yield
  `collections.OrderedDict` objects at each iteration, with the following keys
  and values, in lexicographic order by key:

    -   `'label'`: a `tf.Tensor` with `dtype=tf.int32` and shape [1], the class
        label of the corresponding pixels. Labels [0-9] correspond to the digits
        classes, labels [10-35] correspond to the uppercase classes (e.g., label
        11 is 'B'), and labels [36-61] correspond to the lowercase classes
        (e.g., label 37 is 'b').
    -   `'pixels'`: a `tf.Tensor` with `dtype=tf.float32` and shape [28, 28],
        containing the pixels of the handwritten digit, with values in
        the range [0.0, 1.0].

  Args:
    only_digits: (Optional) whether to only include examples that are from the
      digits [0-9] classes. If `False`, includes lower and upper case
      characters, for a total of 62 class labels.
    cache_dir: (Optional) directory to cache the downloaded file. If `None`,
      caches in Keras' default cache directory.

  Returns:
    Tuple of (train, test) where the tuple elements are
    `tff.simulation.datasets.ClientData` objects.
