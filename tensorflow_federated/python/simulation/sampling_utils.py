  """Builds the function for sampling from the input iterator at each round.

  If an integer `random_seed` is provided, we set a random seed before sampling
  clients according to a multiplicative linear congruential generator (aka
  Lehmer generator, see 'The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 3' by Donald
  Knuth for reference). This does not affect model initialization, shuffling, or
  other such aspects of the federated training process.

  Args:
    sample_range: A 1-D array-like sequence, to be used as input to
      `np.random.choice`. Samples are generated randomly from the elements of
      the sequence.
    replace: A boolean indicating whether the sampling is done with replacement
      (True) or without replacement (False).
    random_seed: If an integer, it is used as a random seed for the client
      sampling process. If None, a nondeterministic seed is used.

  Returns:
    A function that takes as input an integer `round_num` and integer `size` and
    returns a list of `size` elements sampled (pseudo-)randomly from the input
    `sample_range`.
