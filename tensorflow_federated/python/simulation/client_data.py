"""Library methods for working with centralized data used in simulation.

N.B. Federated Learning does not use client IDs or perform any tracking of
clients. However in simulation experiments using centralized test data the
experimenter may select specific clients to be processed per round. The concept
of a client ID is only available at the preprocessing stage when preparing input
data for the simulation and is not part of the TensorFlow Federated core APIs.
