"""A compiler for the mapreduce backend.

In a nutshell, our overall strategy for compiling TFF computations for use with
MapReduce backends involves a three-stage process:

1. Bottom-up generic transformation phase. A sequence of transformations is
   applied that are common across backends. The goal of these is to reduce the
   complexity of the input (e.g., factoring out, merging elements, removing
   no-op code and other syntactic structures that are not needed). This phase
   is bottom-up, in the sense that it isn't driven by a specific target form of
   the output. It may consist or simple transformations applied repeatedly.

2. Top-down transformation phase specific to MapReduce backends. Our knowledge
   of the specific structure of the kind of processing these backends can
   support, captured in the definition of the "MapReduce form" and encoded in
   the definition of the `MapReduceForm` class in `forms.py`, allows
   us to organize transformations in a manner that specifically supports the
   goal of converting a computation AST into the `MapReduceForm` eight-tuple
   of TensorFlow computations. This phase is top-down, in the sense that the
   converter from AST to `MapReduceForm` drives the process (e.g., it triggers
   what we may call a "force align" of certain communication operators, which
   may not make sense or be a valid and safe operation in general, but that is
   possible in the context of the kinds of computations that are convertible
   into a form consumable by MapReduce-like backends).

3. Final conversion from `MapReduceForm` into the form accepted by a given type
   of MapReduce backend, to be handled by the backend-specific code.

The second phase is essentially a form of "divide and conquer" that involves
two essential components:

a. The input computation is organized along the communication boundaries, to
   identify the parts that match the appropriate phases of processing (such as
   the prepare logic, or "everything before broadcast", client-side logic, and
   so on). It uses primitives such as finding all occurrences of a certain
   communication operator, restructuring the computation to align them together,
   what we refer to below as "force align", and calling generic transformations
   to merge the communication operators together.

b. The individual segments of the computation factored out in (a) above are now
   purely local processing (SERVER-only or CLIENTS-only), in which stronger
   assumptions can be made about structure and presence of various syntactic
   elements. Each such segment is reduced into a single section of TensorFlow.

In a nutshell, (a) above by means of force-align and similar mechanisms breaks
up the input computation into several regions on which (b) can be applied to
reduce it into a single TensorFlow section. The problem tackled in (b) is much
simpler than the problem of reducing the entire input computation, hence the
divide-and-conquer.

def consolidate_and_extract_local_processing(comp, grappler_config_proto):
  """Consolidates all the local processing in `comp`.

  The input computation `comp` must have the following properties:

  1. The output of `comp` may be of a federated type or unplaced. We refer to
     the placement `p` of that type as the placement of `comp`. There is no
     placement anywhere in the body of `comp` different than `p`. If `comp`
     is of a functional type, and has a parameter, the type of that parameter
     is a federated type placed at `p` as well, or unplaced if the result of
     the function is unplaced.

  2. The only intrinsics that may appear in the body of `comp` are those that
     manipulate data locally within the same placement. The exact set of these
     intrinsics will be gradually updated. At the moment, we support only the
     following:

     * Either `federated_apply` or `federated_map`, depending on whether `comp`
       is `SERVER`- or `CLIENTS`-placed. `federated_map_all_equal` is also
       allowed in the `CLIENTS`-placed case.

     * Either `federated_value_at_server` or `federated_value_at_clients`,
       likewise placement-dependent.

     * Either `federated_zip_at_server` or `federated_zip_at_clients`, again
       placement-dependent.

     * GENERIC_* intrinsic calls.

     Anything else, including `sequence_*` operators, should have been reduced
     already prior to calling this function.

  3. There are no lambdas in the body of `comp` except for `comp` itself being
     possibly a (top-level) lambda. All other lambdas must have been reduced.
     This requirement may eventually be relaxed by embedding lambda reducer into
     this helper method.

  4. If `comp` is of a functional type, it is either an instance of
     `federated_language.framework.CompiledComputation`, in which case there is
     nothing for
     us to do here, or a `federated_language.framework.Lambda`.

  5. There is at most one unbound reference under `comp`, and this is only
     allowed in the case that `comp` is not of a functional type.

  Aside from the intrinsics specified above, and the possibility of allowing
  lambdas, blocks, and references given the constraints above, the remaining
  constructs in `comp` include a combination of tuples, selections, calls, and
  sections of TensorFlow (as `CompiledComputation`s). This helper function does
  contain the logic to consolidate these constructs.

  The output of this transformation is always a single section of TensorFlow,
  which we henceforth refer to as `result`, the exact form of which depends on
  the placement of `comp` and the presence or absence of an argument.

  a. If there is no argument in `comp`, and `comp` is `SERVER`-placed, then
     the `result` is such that `comp` can be equivalently represented as:

     ```
     federated_value_at_server(result())
     ```

  b. If there is no argument in `comp`, and `comp` is `CLIENTS`-placed, then
     the `result` is such that `comp` can be equivalently represented as:

     ```
     federated_value_at_clients(result())
     ```

  c. If there is an argument in `comp`, and `comp` is `SERVER`-placed, then
     the `result` is such that `comp` can be equivalently represented as:

     ```
     (arg -> federated_apply(<result, arg>))
     ```

  d. If there is an argument in `comp`, and `comp` is `CLIENTS`-placed, then
     the `result` is such that `comp` can be equivalently represented as:

     ```
     (arg -> federated_map(<result, arg>))
     ```

  If the type of `comp` is `T@p` (thus `comp` is non-functional), the type of
  `result` is `T`, where `p` is the specific (concrete) placement of `comp`.

  If the type of `comp` is `(T@p -> U@p)`, then the type of `result` must be
  `(T -> U)`, where `p` is again a specific placement.

  Args:
    comp: An instance of `federated_language.framework.ComputationBuildingBlock`
      that serves as the input to this transformation, as described above.
    grappler_config_proto: An instance of `tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto` to
      configure Grappler graph optimization of the generated TensorFlow graph.
      If `grappler_config_proto` has
      `graph_options.rewrite_options.disable_meta_optimizer=True`, Grappler is
      bypassed.

  Returns:
    An instance of `federated_language.framework.CompiledComputation` that holds
