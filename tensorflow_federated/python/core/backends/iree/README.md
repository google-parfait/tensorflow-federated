This directory contains an emerging software stack that will allow for the use
of IREE in lieu of the eager TensorFlow runtime as an alternative backend. The
code included here should retain private visibility while in incubation stage.

In order to compile this code in OSS, you need to first configure IREE in your
local Python environment. When the IREE pip package becomes available, we will
take a dependency on it.
