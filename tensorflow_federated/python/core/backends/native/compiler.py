  This function transforms the proto underlying `comp` by transforming it
  to call-dominant form (see `tff.framework.to_call_dominant` for
  definition).

  Args:
    comp: Instance of `computation_impl.ConcreteComputation` to compile.
    transform_math_to_tf: Whether to additional transform math to TensorFlow
      graphs. Necessary if running on a execution state without
      ReferenceResolvingExecutors underneath FederatingExecutors.
    grappler_config: Configuration for Grappler optimizations to perform on the
      TensorFlow computations. If `None`, Grappler will not be run and no
      optimizations wil be applied.

  Returns:
    A new `computation_impl.ConcreteComputation` representing the compiled
      version of `comp`.
