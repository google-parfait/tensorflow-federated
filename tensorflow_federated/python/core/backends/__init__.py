"""Backends for constructing, compiling, and executing computations.

Computations expressed in TFF can be executed on a variety of backends,
including native backends that implement TFF's interfaces such as
`federated_language.framework.Executor`, as well as custom non-native backends
such as MapReduce-like systems that may only be able to run a subset of
computations expressibe in TFF.
