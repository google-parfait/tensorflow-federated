  """A stateful process that aggregates values.

  This class inherits the constraints documented by
  `tff.templates.MeasuredProcess`.

  A `tff.templates.AggregationProcess` is a `tff.templates.MeasuredProcess`
  that formalizes the type signature of `initialize_fn` and `next_fn` for
  aggregation.

  Compared to the `tff.templates.MeasuredProcess`, this class requires a second
  input argument, which is a value placed at `CLIENTS` and to be aggregated.
  The `result` field of returned `tff.templates.MeasuredProcessOutput`,
  representing the aggregate, must be placed at `SERVER` and does not
  necessarily need to have type signature equal to the type signature of the
  second input argument.

  The intended composition pattern for `tff.templates.AggregationProcess` is
  that of nesting. An aggregation will broadly consist of three logical parts:
    - A pre-aggregation computation placed at `CLIENTS`.
    - Actual aggregation.
    - A post-aggregation computation placed at `SERVER`.
  The second step can be realized by direct application of appropriate intrinsic
  such as `tff.federated_sum`, or by delegation to (one or more) "inner"
  aggregation processes.

  Both `initialize` and `next` must be `tff.Computation`s with the following
  type signatures:
    - initialize: `( -> S@SERVER)`
    - next: `(<S@SERVER, V@CLIENTS, *> ->
              <state=S@SERVER, result=V'@SERVER, measurements=M@SERVER>)`
  where `*` represents optional other arguments placed at `CLIENTS`. This can be
  used for weighted aggregation, where the third parameter is the weight.

  Note that while the value type to be aggregated will often be preserved
  (i.e., `V == V'`), it is not required. An example is sampling-based
  aggregation.
