  """A `tff.templates.IterativeProcess` with a specific output signature.

  A `tff.templates.MeasuredProcess` is a `tff.templates.IterativeProcess` that
  formalizes the output signature of the `next` property to be a named
  three-tuple `<state,result,measurements>`. This definition enables
  `tff.templates.MeasuredProcess` to be composed following the rules below,
  something that wasn't possible with the more generic, less defined
  `tff.templates.IterativeProcess`.

  *Rules of Composition*
  Given two `MeasuredProcess` _F(x)_ and _G(y)_, a new composition _C_ is
  also a `MeasuredProcess` where:
    - `C.state` is the concatenation `<F.state, G.state>`.
    - `C.result` is the result of _G_ applied to the result of
      _F_ `G(G.state, F(F.state, x).result).result`.
    - `C.measurements` is the concatenation `<F.measurements, G.measurements>`.

  The resulting composition _C_ would have the following type signatures:
    initialize: `( -> <F.initialize, G.initialize>)`
    next: `(<<F.state, G.state>, F.input> -> <state=<F.state, G.State>,
      result=G.result, measurements=<F.measurements, G.measurements>)`

        `initialize_fn` returns a type `S`, then `next_fn` must return a TFF
        type `<state=S,result=O,measurements=M>`, and accept either a single
