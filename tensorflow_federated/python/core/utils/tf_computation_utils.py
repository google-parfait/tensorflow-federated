  Unlike `tf.get_variables`, this method will always create new variables,

  Args:
    name: The common name to use for the scope in which all of the variables are
      to be created.
    type_spec: An instance of `tff.Type` or something convertible to it. The
      type signature may only be composed of tensor types and named tuples,
      possibly nested.
    **kwargs: Additional keyword args to pass to `tf.Variable` construction.

  Returns:
    Either a single variable when invoked with a tensor TFF type, or a nested
    structure of variables created in the appropriately-named variable scopes
    made up of anonymous tuples if invoked with a named tuple TFF type.

  Raises:
