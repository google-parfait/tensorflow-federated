  """Makes a `DPQuery` to estimate vector averages with differential privacy.

  Supports many of the types of query available in tensorflow_privacy, including
  nested ("per-vector") queries as described in
  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06210.pdf, and quantile-based adaptive clipping as
  described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03871.

  Args:
    clip: The query's L2 norm bound.
    noise_multiplier: The ratio of the (effective) noise stddev to the clip.
    expected_total_weight: The expected total weight of all clients, used as the
      denominator for the average computation.
    adaptive_clip_learning_rate: Learning rate for quantile-based adaptive
      clipping. If 0, fixed clipping is used. If `per_vector_clipping=True` and
      `geometric_clip_update=False`, the learning rate of each vector is
      proportional to that vector's initial clip.
    target_unclipped_quantile: Target unclipped quantile for adaptive clipping.
    clipped_count_budget_allocation: The fraction of privacy budget to use for
      estimating clipped counts.
    expected_num_clients: The expected number of clients for estimating clipped
      fractions.
    per_vector_clipping: If True, clip each weight tensor independently.
      Otherwise, global clipping is used. The clipping norm for each vector (or
      the initial clipping norm, in the case of adaptive clipping) is
      proportional to the sqrt of the vector dimensionality such that the root
      sum squared of the individual clips equals `clip`.
    geometric_clip_update: If True, use geometric updating of the clip.
    model: A `tff.learning.Model` to determine the structure of model weights.
      Required only if per_vector_clipping is True.

  Returns:
    A `DPQuery` suitable for use in a call to `build_dp_aggregate` to perform
      Federated Averaging with differential privacy.

  The returned `StatefulAggregateFn` can be called with any nested structure for
  the values being statefully aggregated. However, it's necessary to provide two
  functions as arguments which indicate the properties (the `tff.Type` and the
  `anonymous_tuple.AnonymousTuple` conversion) of the nested structure that will
  be used. If using a `collections.OrderedDict` as the value's nested structure,
  the defaults for the arguments suffice.

  Args:
    query: A DPQuery to aggregate. For compatibility with tensorflow_federated,
      the global_state and sample_state of the query must be structures
      supported by tf.nest.
    value_type_fn: Python function that takes the value argument of next_fn and
      returns the value type. This will be used in determining the TensorSpecs
      that establish the initial sample state. If the value being aggregated is
      an `collections.OrderedDict`, the default for this argument can be used.
      This argument probably gets removed once b/123092620 is addressed (and the
      associated processing step gets replaced with a simple call to
      `value.type_signature.member`).
    from_tff_result_fn: Python function that takes a client record and converts
      it to the container type that it was in before passing through TFF. (Right
      now, TFF computation causes the client record to be changed into an
      `anonymous_tuple.AnonymousTuple`, and this method corrects for that). If
      the value being aggregated is an `collections.OrderedDict`, the default
      for this argument can be used. This argument likely goes away once
      b/123092620 is addressed. The default behavior assumes that the client
      record (before being converted to (as it `anonymous_tuple.AnonymousTuple`)
      was an `collections.OrderedDict` containing a flat structure of Tensors is
      if using the `tff.learning` APIs like
      `tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process`).

  Returns:
    A tuple of:
