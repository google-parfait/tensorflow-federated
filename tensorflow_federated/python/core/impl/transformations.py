def extract_intrinsics(comp):
  r"""Extracts intrinsics to the scope which binds any variable it depends on.

  This transform traverses `comp` postorder, matches the following pattern, and
  replaces the following computation containing a called intrinsic:

        ...
           \
            Call
           /    \
  Intrinsic      ...

  with the following computation containing a block with the extracted called
  intrinsic:

                  Block
                 /     \
         [x=Call]       ...
           /    \          \
  Intrinsic      ...        Ref(x)

  The called intrinsics are extracted to the scope which binds any variable the
  called intrinsic depends. If the called intrinsic is not bound by any
  computation in `comp` it will be extracted to the root. Both the
  `parameter_name` of a `computation_building_blocks.Lambda` and the name of any
  variable defined by a `computation_building_blocks.Block` can affect the scope
  in which a reference in called intrinsic is bound.

  NOTE: This function will also extract blocks to the scope in which they are
  bound because block variables can restrict the scope in which intrinsics are
  bound.

  Args:
    comp: The computation building block in which to perform the extractions.
      The names of lambda parameters and block variables in `comp` must be
      unique.

  Returns:
    A new computation with the transformation applied or the original `comp`.

  Raises:
    TypeError: If types do not match.
    ValueError: If `comp` contains variables with non-unique names.

  The functional computations `f1`, `f2`, etc..., and the computations `v1`,
  `v2`, etc... are retained; the other computations are replaced.

  NOTE: This is just an example of what this transformation would look like when
  applied to a tuple of federated maps. The components `f1`, `f2`, `v1`, and
  `v2` and the number of those components are not important.

  This transformation is implemented to match the following intrinsics:

  * intrinsic_defs.FEDERATED_AGGREGATE.uri
  * intrinsic_defs.FEDERATED_APPLY.uri
  * intrinsic_defs.FEDERATED_BROADCAST.uri
  * intrinsic_defs.FEDERATED_MAP.uri

  Args:

  Returns:

  """Callable taking subset of TFF AST constructs to CompiledComputations.

  When this function is applied via `transformation_utils.transform_postorder`
  to a TFF AST node satisfying its assumptions,  the tree under this node will
  be reduced to a single instance of
  `computation_building_blocks.CompiledComputation` representing the same
  logic.

  Notice that this function is designed to be applied to what is essentially
  a subtree of a larger TFF AST; once the processing on a single device has
  been aligned at the AST level, and placement separated from the logic of
  this processing, we should be left with a function wrapped via
  `federated_map` or `federated_apply` to a federated argument. It is this
  function which we need to reduce to TensorFlow, and it is to the root
  node of this function which we are looking to apply `TFParser`. Because of
  this, we assume that there is a lambda expression at the top of the AST
  we are looking to parse, as well as the rest of the assumptions below.

  1. All called lambdas have been converted to blocks.
  2. All blocks have been inlined; that is, there are no block/LET constructs
     remaining.
  3. All compiled computations are called.
  4. No compiled computations have been partially called; we believe this
     should be handled correctly today but we haven't reasoned explicitly about
     this possibility.
  5. The only leaf nodes present under `comp` are compiled computations and
     references to the argument of the top-level lambda which we are hoping to
     replace with a compiled computation. Further, every leaf node which is a
     reference has as its parent a `computation_building_blocks.Call`, whose
     associated function is a TF graph. This prevents us from needing to
     deal with arbitrary nesting of references and TF graphs, and significantly
     clarifies the reasoning. This can be accomplished by "decorating" the
     appropriate leaves with called identity TF graphs, the construction of
     which is provided by a utility module.
  6. There is only a single lambda binding any references present in the AST,
     and it is placed at the root of the AST to which we apply `TFParser`.
  7. There are no intrinsics present in the AST.

  For ease of reasoning about and proving completeness of TFF-to-TF
  translation capabilities, we will maintain the invariant that
  we constantly pass up the AST instances of the pattern:

                                    Call

  Any block of TFF reducible to TensorFlow must have a functional type
  signature without nested functions, and therefore we may assume there is
  a single Reference in the code we are parsing to TF. We continually push logic
  into the compiled computation as we make our way up the AST, preserving the
  pattern above; when we hit the lambda that binds this reference, we simply
  unwrap the call.

  To perform this process, we must begin with this pattern; otherwise there
  may be some arbitrary TFF constructs present between any occurrences of TF
  and the arguments to which they are applied, e.g. arbitrary selections from
  and nesting of tuples containing references.

  `insert_called_tf_identity_at_leaves` ensures that the pattern above is
  present at the leaves of any portion of the TFF AST which is destined to be
  reduced to TF.

  We detect such a destiny by checking for the existence of a
  `computation_building_blocks.Lambda` whose parameter and result type
  can both be bound into TensorFlow. This pattern is enforced here as
  parameter validation on `comp`.

    comp: Instance of `computation_building_blocks.Lambda` whose AST we will

  Compuations that are equal will have the same collections of unbounded
  references, so it is safe to use `comp` as the key for this `dict` even though
  a given compuation may appear in many positions in the AST.

  Args:
    comp: The computation building block to parse.

  Returns:
    A Python `dict` of elements where keys are the compuations in `comp` and
    values are a Python `set` of the names of the unbound references in the
    subtree of that compuation.
