def transform_postorder(comp, func):
  """Traverses `comp` recursively postorder and replaces its constituents.

  For each element of `comp` viewed as an expression tree, the transformation
  `func` is applied first to building blocks it is parameterized by, then the
  element itself. The transformation `func` should act as an identity function
  on the kinds of elements (computation building blocks) it does not care to
  transform. This corresponds to a post-order traversal of the expression tree,
  i.e., parameters are alwaysd transformed left-to-right (in the order in which
  they are listed in building block constructors), then the parent is visited
  and transformed with the already-visited, and possibly transformed arguments
  in place.

  NOTE: In particular, in `Call(f,x)`, both `f` and `x` are arguments to `Call`.
  Therefore, `f` is transformed into `f'`, next `x` into `x'` and finally,
  `Call(f',x')` is transformed at the end.

  Args:
    comp: The computation to traverse and transform bottom-up.
    func: The transformation to apply locally to each building block in `comp`.
      It is a Python function that accepts a building block at input, and should
      return either the same, or transformed building block at output. Both the
      intput and output of `func` are instances of `ComputationBuildingBlock`.

  Returns:
    The result of applying `func` to parts of `comp` in a bottom-up fashion.

  Raises:
    TypeError: If the arguments are of the wrong computation_types.
    NotImplementedError: If the argument is a kind of computation building block
      that is currently not recognized.
