def replace_intrinsics_with_bodies(comp):
  """Reduces intrinsics to their bodies as defined in `intrinsic_bodies.py`.

  This function operates on the AST level; meaning, it takes in a
  `building_blocks.ComputationBuildingBlock` as an argument and
  returns one as well. `replace_intrinsics_with_bodies` is intended to be the
  standard reduction function, which will reduce all currently implemented
  intrinsics to their bodies.

  Notice that the success of this function depends on the contract of
  `intrinsic_bodies.get_intrinsic_bodies`, that the dict returned by that
  function is ordered from more complex intrinsic to less complex intrinsics.

  Args:
    comp: Instance of `building_blocks.ComputationBuildingBlock` in which we
      wish to replace all intrinsics with their bodies.

  Returns:
    An instance of `building_blocks.ComputationBuildingBlock` with
    all intrinsics defined in `intrinsic_bodies.py` replaced with their bodies.
