  """Divides `comp` into before-and-after of calls to one or more intrinsics.

  The input computation `comp` must have the following properties:

  1. The computation `comp` is completely self-contained, i.e., there are no
     references to arguments introduced in a scope external to `comp`.

  2. `comp`'s return value must not contain uncalled lambdas.

  3. None of the calls to intrinsics in `intrinsic_defaults` may be
     within a lambda passed to another external function (intrinsic or
     compiled computation).

  4. No argument passed to an intrinsic in `intrinsic_defaults` may be
     dependent on the result of a call to an intrinsic in
     `intrinsic_uris_and_defaults`.

  5. All intrinsics in `intrinsic_defaults` must have "merge-able" arguments.
     Structs will be merged element-wise, federated values will be zipped, and
     functions will be composed:
       `f = lambda f1_arg, f2_arg: (f1(f1_arg), f2(f2_arg))`

  6. All intrinsics in `intrinsic_defaults` must return a single federated value
     whose member is the merged result of any merged calls, i.e.:
       `f(merged_arg).member = (f1(f1_arg).member, f2(f2_arg).member)`

  Under these conditions, (and assuming `comp` is a computation with non-`None`
  argument), this function will return two `building_blocks.Lambda`s `before`
  and `after` such that `comp` is semantically equivalent to the following
  expression*:

  ```
  (arg -> (let
    x=before(arg),
    y=intrinsic1(x[0]),
    z=intrinsic2(x[1]),
    ...
   in after(<arg, <y,z,...>>)))
  ```

  If `comp` is a no-arg computation, the returned computations will be
  equivalent (in the same sense as above) to:
  ```
  ( -> (let
    x=before(),
    y=intrinsic1(x[0]),
    z=intrinsic2(x[1]),
    ...
   in after(<y,z,...>)))
  ```

  *Note that these expressions may not be entirely equivalent under
  nondeterminism since there is no way in this case to handle computations in
  which `before` creates a random variable that is then used in `after`, since
  the only way for state to pass from `before` to `after` is for it to travel
  through one of the intrinsics.

  In this expression, there is only a single call to `intrinsic` that results
  from consolidating all occurrences of this intrinsic in the original `comp`.
  All logic in `comp` that produced inputs to any these intrinsic calls is now
  consolidated and jointly encapsulated in `before`, which produces a combined
  argument to all the original calls. All the remaining logic in `comp`,
  including that which consumed the outputs of the intrinsic calls, must have
  been encapsulated into `after`.

  If the original computation `comp` had type `(T -> U)`, then `before` and
  `after` would be `(T -> X)` and `(<T,Y> -> U)`, respectively, where `X` is
  the type of the argument to the single combined intrinsic call above. Note
  that `after` takes the output of the call to the intrinsic as well as the
  original argument to `comp`, as it may be dependent on both.

  Args:
    comp: The instance of `building_blocks.Lambda` that serves as the input to
      this transformation, as described above.
    intrinsic_defaults: A list of intrinsics with which to split the
      computation, provided as a list of `Call`s to insert if no intrinsic with
      a matching URI is found. Intrinsics in this list will be merged, and
      `comp` will be split across them.

  Returns:
    A pair of the form `(before, after)`, where each of `before` and `after`
    is a `building_blocks.ComputationBuildingBlock` instance that represents a
    part of the result as specified above.

  """Divides `comp` into three components (before, intrinsic, after).

  The input computation `comp` must have the following properties:

  1. It has a non-None input parameter. (This requirement allows the
    implementation to be slightly simpler, but it can be removed in the future
    if necessary.)

  2. The computation `comp` is completely self-contained, i.e., there are no
    unbound references in `comp`.

  3. None of the calls to intrinsics in `intrinsic_defs_to_split` may be within
    a lambda passed to another external function (intrinsic or compiled
    computation).

  4. No argument passed to an intrinsic in `intrinsic_defs_to_split` may be
    dependent on the result of another call to an intrinsic in
    `intrinsic_defs_to_split`.

  Under these conditions, this function will return three
  `building_blocks.Lambda`s `before`, `intrinsic`, and `after` such that
  `comp` is semantically equivalent to the following expression:
  ```
  (arg -> (let
    <"intrinsic_args_from_before_comp": x, "intermediate_state": temp> =
          before(<before_subparam_0(arg), before_subparam_1(arg), ...>)
    y = intrinsic(<intrinsic_subparam_0(arg), intrinsic_subparam_1(arg), ...,
          "intrinsic_args_from_before_comp": x>)
   in after(<after_subparam_0(arg), after_subparam_1(arg), ...,
          "intrinsic_results": y, "intermediate_state": temp>)
  ))
  ```

  The `*_allowed_original_arg_subparameters` arguments are used to specify which
  parts of the original computation input each of the split computatations is
  allowed to depend on. Each of these arguments takes a list of paths of integer
  indices that describe selections of the original computation input. For
  example, [(3,1,), (2,)] would mean that usage of arg[3][1] and arg[2] is
  permitted in the applicable output comp. An empty path list means that no
  part of the original computation input may be used, whereas [()] means that
  all parts of the original computation input may be used.

  The `before` computation will only use parts of `comp`'s input that are
  permitted by `before_comp_allowed_original_arg_subparameters`. It returns a
  tuple containing one of the inputs to the `intrinsic` computation and the
  minimal temporary state that is needed in the `after` computation.

  The `intrinsic` computation consists solely of calls to intrinsics in
  `intrinsic_defs_to_split`. Each intrinsic call will only use parts of `comp`'s
  input permitted by `intrinsic_comp_allowed_original_arg_subparameters` and/or
  the first part of the `before` result. The i-th entry of the output struct
  will be the result of the i-th intrinsic call. If the original computation
  contains calls to intrinsics that are not in `intrinsic_defs_to_split`, these
  calls will become part of either the `before` or `after` computations.

  The `after` computation takes as input the parts of the original `comp`
  argument allowed by `after_comp_allowed_original_arg_subparameters`, the
  result of `intrinsic`, and the temporary state produced by `before`. It
  returns the same output as the original computation.

  The input computation will be partitioned without repetition across the three
  output computations, meaning that no top-level call from the original input
  computation's CDF will appear in more than of the output computations. This
  is important since some calls may be non-deterministic and repeating them
  across the output computations may cause unexpected results to be produced
  when the output computations are executed. The link between the `before` and
  `after` comps via `intermediate_state` exists to ensure that this non-
  repetition guarantee can be met. The `intermediate_state` that is produced
  is not guaranteed to minimal, however.

  If it is not possible to split an input computation according to the allowed
  subparameters and the available channels between the three output
  computations, an error will be raised. If a valid split does exist, this
  function is guaranteed to find it.

  Args:
    comp: The instance of `building_blocks.Lambda` that serves as the input to
      this transformation, as described above.
    intrinsic_defs_to_split: A list of intrinsics with which to split the
      computation.
    before_comp_allowed_original_arg_subparameters: A list of paths describing
      the selections into the original comp input that can be used within the
      `before` comp.
    intrinsic_comp_allowed_original_arg_subparameters: A list of paths
      describing the selections into the original comp input that can be used
      within the `intrinsic` comp.
    after_comp_allowed_original_arg_subparameters: A list of paths describing
      the selections into the original comp input that can be used within the
      `after` comp.

  Returns:
    A tuple of the form `(before, intrinsic, after)`, where each of `before`,
    `intrinsic`, and `after` is a building_blocks.Lambda` instance with a
    `building_blocks.Block` result.

    Details about the inputs and outputs of the three computations as well as
    the contents of the `intrinsic` comp are specified above.

  Raises:
    TypeError: If arguments are not the documented types.
    NonAlignableAlongIntrinsicError: If the intrinsics to split on are not
      independent of each other.
    UnavailableRequiredInputsError: If the computation cannot be split due to
      inputs that are required but not available based on the provided

  # The following code attempts to construct a split using these steps:
  # 1. Check that the inputs are valid and categorize the locals in the original
  #    comp's result block.
  # 2. Produce a preliminary intrinsic comp that returns the outputs of the
  #    intrinsic calls and depends only on the allowed original input
  #    subparameters.
  # 3. Extend the input for the intrinsic comp to make it valid (i.e. resolve
  #    any unbound references).
  # 4. Produce a preliminary after comp that returns the original output and
  #    depends only on the allowed original input subparameters and the output
  #    from the intrinsic comp.
  # 5. Extend the input for the after comp to make it valid (i.e. resolve any
  #    unbound references).
  # 6. Attempt to produce an input comp that returns the two extensions required
  #    by steps 3 and 5 while only depending on the allowed original input
  #    subparameters. If this fails (i.e. unbound references exist), a split is
  #    not possible and an error is raised.
  # 7. Remove any repetition across the before and after comps.
  # 8. Normalize the output comps and check that their structure meets the
  #    promised guarantees.
