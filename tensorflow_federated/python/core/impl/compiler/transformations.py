  """Divides `comp` into before-and-after of calls to one ore more intrinsics.

  The input computation `comp` must have the following properties:

  1. The computation `comp` is completely self-contained, i.e., there are no
     references to arguments introduced in a scope external to `comp`.

  2. `comp`'s return value must not contain uncalled lambdas.

  3. None of the calls to intrinsics in `intrinsic_defaults` may be
     within a lambda passed to another external function (intrinsic or
     compiled computation).

  4. No argument passed to an intrinsic in `intrinsic_defaults` may be
     dependent on the result of a call to an intrinsic in
     `intrinsic_uris_and_defaults`.

  5. All intrinsics in `intrinsic_defaults` must have "merge-able" arguments.
     Structs will be merged element-wise, federated values will be zipped, and
     functions will be composed:
       `f = lambda f1_arg, f2_arg: (f1(f1_arg), f2(f2_arg))`

  6. All intrinsics in `intrinsic_defaults` must return a single federated value
     whose member is the merged result of any merged calls, i.e.:
       `f(merged_arg).member = (f1(f1_arg).member, f2(f2_arg).member)`

  Under these conditions, (and assuming `comp` is a computation with non-`None`
  argument), this function will return two `building_blocks.Lambda`s `before`
  and `after` such that `comp` is semantically equivalent to the following
  expression*:

  ```
  (arg -> (let
    x=before(arg),
    y=intrinsic1(x[0]),
    z=intrinsic2(x[1]),
    ...
   in after(<arg, <y,z,...>>)))
  ```

  If `comp` is a no-arg computation, the returned computations will be
  equivalent (in the same sense as above) to:
  ```
  ( -> (let
    x=before(),
    y=intrinsic1(x[0]),
    z=intrinsic2(x[1]),
    ...
   in after(<y,z,...>)))
  ```

  *Note that these expressions may not be entirely equivalent under
  nondeterminism since there is no way in this case to handle computations in
  which `before` creates a random variable that is then used in `after`, since
  the only way for state to pass from `before` to `after` is for it to travel
  through one of the intrinsics.

  In this expression, there is only a single call to `intrinsic` that results
  from consolidating all occurrences of this intrinsic in the original `comp`.
  All logic in `comp` that produced inputs to any these intrinsic calls is now
  consolidated and jointly encapsulated in `before`, which produces a combined
  argument to all the original calls. All the remaining logic in `comp`,
  including that which consumed the outputs of the intrinsic calls, must have
  been encapsulated into `after`.

  If the original computation `comp` had type `(T -> U)`, then `before` and
  `after` would be `(T -> X)` and `(<T,Y> -> U)`, respectively, where `X` is
  the type of the argument to the single combined intrinsic call above. Note
  that `after` takes the output of the call to the intrinsic as well as the
  original argument to `comp`, as it may be dependent on both.

  Args:
    comp: The instance of `building_blocks.Lambda` that serves as the input to
      this transformation, as described above.
    intrinsic_defaults: A list of intrinsics with which to split the
      computation, provided as a list of `Call`s to insert if no intrinsic with
      a matching URI is found. Intrinsics in this list will be merged, and
      `comp` will be split across them.

  Returns:
    A pair of the form `(before, after)`, where each of `before` and `after`
    is a `building_blocks.ComputationBuildingBlock` instance that represents a
    part of the result as specified above.

  """Resolves unbound references in `comp` by extending the input parameter.

  This is a private helper method intended to be used only in constructing the
  DistributeAggregateForm for a computation.

  We attempt to re-write `comp` such that a minimal amount of information gets
  passed through the extended input parameter. In other words, if we encounter
  a selection such as unbound_arg[0] in `comp`, the extended input parameter
  will contain a new value that can be used in place of unbound_arg[0] rather
  than in place of unbound_arg. As another example, if we encounter a struct
  such as [unbound_arg, bound_arg], the extended input parameter will contain a
  new value that can be used in place of unbound_arg rather than in place of the
  entire struct. We do not go so far as replacing entire calls, however, so
  for something like federated_sum(unbound_arg[0]) we would just add a new value
  to the extended input parameter that can be used in place of the argument to
  the call.

  Args:
    comp: The lambda computation potentially containing unbound references. The
      lambda must be in CDF, the input parameter must be a struct, and the input
      parameter must always be used via a selection and never used directly.
    lambda_parameter_extension_name: The name of the new element in the input
      parameter struct.

  Returns:
    A tuple containing
      - The revised lambda computation, which is guaranteed to have 1 more
        element in the input parameter struct and no unbound references.
      - A list of the `ComputationBuildingBlock`s that were replaced by
        selections and whose values are now expected to be supplied to the new
        input.

  Raises:
    TypeError: If types do not match.
    ValueError: If the input parameter is used within the computation in ways
      that are unsupported.
