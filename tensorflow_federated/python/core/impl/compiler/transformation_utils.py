def transform_postorder(comp, transform):
  """Traverses `comp` recursively postorder and replaces its constituents.

  For each element of `comp` viewed as an expression tree, the transformation
  `transform` is applied first to building blocks it is parameterized by, then
  the element itself. The transformation `transform` should act as an identity
  function on the kinds of elements (computation building blocks) it does not
  care to transform. This corresponds to a post-order traversal of the
  expression tree, i.e., parameters are always transformed left-to-right (in
  the order in which they are listed in building block constructors), then the
  parent is visited and transformed with the already-visited, and possibly
  transformed arguments in place.

  Note: In particular, in `Call(f,x)`, both `f` and `x` are arguments to `Call`.
  Therefore, `f` is transformed into `f'`, next `x` into `x'` and finally,
  `Call(f',x')` is transformed at the end.

  Args:
    comp: A `computation_building_block.ComputationBuildingBlock` to traverse
      and transform bottom-up.
    transform: The transformation to apply locally to each building block in
      `comp`. It is a Python function that accepts a building block at input,
      and should return a (building block, bool) tuple as output, where the
      building block is a `computation_building_block.ComputationBuildingBlock`
      representing either the original building block or a transformed building
      block and the bool is a flag indicating if the building block was modified
      as.

  Returns:
    The result of applying `transform` to parts of `comp` in a bottom-up
    fashion, along with a Boolean with the value `True` if `comp` was
    transformed and `False` if it was not.

  Raises:
    TypeError: If the arguments are of the wrong computation_types.
    NotImplementedError: If the argument is a kind of computation building block
      that is currently not recognized.

def transform_postorder_with_symbol_bindings(comp, transform, symbol_tree):
  """Uses symbol binding hooks to execute transformations.

  `transform_postorder_with_symbol_bindings` hooks into the preorder traversal
  that is defined by walking down the tree to its leaves, using
  the variable bindings along this path to push information onto
  the given `SymbolTree`. Once we hit the leaves, we walk back up the
  tree in a postorder fashion, calling `transform` as we go.

  The transformations `transform_postorder_with_symbol_bindings` executes are
  therefore stateful in some sense. Here 'stateful' means that a transformation
  executed on a given AST node in general depends on not only the node itself
  or its immediate vicinity; possibly there is some global information on which
  this transformation depends. `transform_postorder_with_symbol_bindings` is
  functional 'from AST to AST' (where `comp` represents the root of an AST) but
  not 'from node to node'.

  One important fact to note: there are recursion invariants that
  `transform_postorder_with_symbol_bindings` uses the `SymbolTree` data
  structure to enforce. In particular, within a `transform` call the following
  invariants hold:

  *  `symbol_tree.update_payload_with_name` with an argument `name` will call
     `update` on the `BoundVariableTracker` in `symbol_tree` which tracks the
     value of `ref` active in the current lexical scope. Will raise a
     `NameError` if none exists.

  *  `symbol_tree.get_payload_with_name` with a string argument `name` will
     return the `BoundVariableTracker` instance from `symbol_tree` which
     corresponds to the computation bound to the variable `name` in the current
     lexical scope. Will raise a `NameError` if none exists.

  These recursion invariants are enforced by the framework, and should be
  relied on when designing new transformations that depend on variable
  bindings.

  Args:
    comp: Instance of `building_blocks.ComputationBuildingBlock` to read
      information from or transform.
    transform: Python function accepting `comp` and `symbol_tree` arguments and
      returning `transformed_comp`.
    symbol_tree: Instance of `SymbolTree`, the data structure into which we may
      read information about variable bindings, and from which we may read.

  Returns:
    Returns a possibly modified version of `comp`, an instance
    of `building_blocks.ComputationBuildingBlock`, along with a
    Boolean with the value `True` if `comp` was transformed and `False` if it
    was not.
