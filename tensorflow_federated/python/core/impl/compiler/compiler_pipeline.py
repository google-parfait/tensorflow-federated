  The `CompilerPipeline` holds very little logic; caching for the
  artifacts it generates and essentially nothing else. The `CompilerPipeline`
  is initialized with a `compilation_function`, to which the pipeline itself
  delegates all the actual work of compilation.

  Different TFF backends may accept different executable artifacts; e.g. a
  backend that supports only a map-reduce execution model may accept instances
  of `tff.backends.mapreduce.CanonicalForm`. The TFF representation of such a
  backend takes the form of an instance of `tff.framework.Context`, which would
  be initialized with a `CompilerPipeline` whose `compilation_function` accepts
  `tff.Computations` and returns CanonicalForms.
