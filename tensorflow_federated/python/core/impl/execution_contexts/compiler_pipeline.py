  """An interface for generating executable artifacts.

  The `CompilerPipeline` holds very little logic; caching for the
  artifacts it generates and essentially nothing else. The `CompilerPipeline`
  is initialized with a `compilation_function`, to which the pipeline itself
  delegates all the actual work of compilation.

  Different TFF backends may accept different executable artifacts; e.g. a
  backend that supports only a map-reduce execution model may accept instances
  of `tff.backends.mapreduce.MapReduceForm`. The TFF representation of such a
  backend takes the form of an instance of `tff.framework.SyncContext` or
  `tff.framework.AsyncContext` , which would be initialized with a
  `CompilerPipeline` whose `compilation_fn` accepts `tff.Computations` and
  returns MapReduceForms.
