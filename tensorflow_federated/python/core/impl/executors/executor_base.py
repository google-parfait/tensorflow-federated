    This function is used to embed a value within the executor. The argument
    can be one of the plain Python types, a nested structure, a representation
    of a TFF computation, etc. Once embedded, the value can be further passed
    around within the executor. For functional values, embedding them prior to
    invocation potentially allows the executor to amortize overhead across
    multiple calls.

      value: An object that represents the value to embed within the executor.
      type_spec: An optional `tff.Type` of the value represented by this object,
        or something convertible to it. The type can only be omitted if the
