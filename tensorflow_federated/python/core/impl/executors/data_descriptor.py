  """Represent data-yielding computations with unspecified cardinalities.

  Instances of this class are objects that may combine a federated computation
  that returns federated data and an argument to be supplied as input to this
  computation, or alternatively the argument alone. These objects are designed
  to be recognized by the runtime. When ingesting those objects (e.g., as they
  are passed as arguments to a computation invocation), the runtime ingests
  the argument, and (if provided) invokes the computation contained
  in this descriptor on this argument to cause the data to materialize within
  the runtime (but without marshaling it out and returning it to user).

  In the typical usage of this helper class, the embedded argument is a set of
  handles, and the embedded computation transforms those handles into physical
  `tf.data.Dataset` instances. This transformation occurs on the clients (i.e.,
  in the TFF runtime worker processes).

  Alternatively, the argument itself may consist of computations to be locally
  executed on the clients. In this case, the computation can be omitted.
