"""Defines context interfaces which evaluates computation invocations.

Invocations of TensorFlow Federated computations need to be treated differently
depending on the context in which they are invoked. For example:

*   During top-level Python simulations, computation invocations result in the
    computation being serialized and evaluated by the TensorFlow native runtime.

*   In functions decorated wtih `@tff.tf_computation`, computation invocations
    must import the body of the invoked function into the current TensorFlow
    graph.

Code can customize the way in which each of these calls are evaluated by setting
a specific context using a global or thread-local context stack.
