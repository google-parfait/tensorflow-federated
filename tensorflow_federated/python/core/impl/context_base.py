  """Represents the interface to the context that the API executes against.

  The interfaces in Core API may be used in a variety of contexts, such as at a
  compile time or at runtime, during unit tests, nested inside a body of an
  outer computation being defined or at the top level (not nested), and in the
  former case potentially nested more than one level deep, either in a general
  orchestration scope or in a section of TensorFlow code, as well as potentially
  in an undecorated regular Python function or a tfe.defun. The context of usage
  potentially affects some of the API, determines which subset of the API is
  available, and it can influence the manner in which the API calls behave. This
  interface abstracts out interactions between the API and the underlying
  context for mechanisms that are context-dependent. The API only interacts with
  a given current context (instance). Manipulating a context stack is the
  responsibility of the implementation.

    to translate them into a form that can be used in the given context. This
    is performed in the process of handling a computation's `__call__()`, while

    Prior to calling `invoke`, the argument `arg` or its constituents must have

    Args:
      comp: The computation being invoked. The Python type of `comp` expected
        here (e.g., `pb.Computation`. `ComputationImpl`, or other) may depend on
        the context. It is the responsibility of the concrete implementation of
        this interface to verify that the type of `comp` matches what the
        context is expecting.
      arg: The optional argument of the call (possibly an argument tuple with a
        nested structure), or `None` if no argument was supplied. Computations
        accept arguments in a variety of forms, but those are first ingested by
        calling `ingest()` above, then bundled together into a single object
