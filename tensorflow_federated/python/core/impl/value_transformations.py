  This transform traverses `comp` postorder and replaces all the intrinsics with
  the given `uri` with a polymorphic callable that represents the body of the
  implementation of the intrinsic; i.e., one that given the parameter of the
  intrinsic constructs the intended result. This will typically be a Python
  function decorated with `@federated_computation` to make it into a polymorphic
  callable.

  Args:
    comp: The computation building block in which to perform the replacements.
    uri: The URI of the intrinsic to replace.
    body: A polymorphic callable.
    context_stack: The context stack to use.

  Returns:

  """Iterates over all intrinsic bodies, inlining the intrinsics in `comp`.

  This function operates on the AST level; meaning, it takes in a
  `building_blocks.ComputationBuildingBlock` as an argument and
  returns one as well. `replace_intrinsics_with_bodies` is intended to be the
  standard reduction function, which will reduce all currently implemented
  intrinsics to their bodies.

  Notice that the success of this function depends on the contract of
  `intrinsic_bodies.get_intrinsic_bodies`, that the dict returned by that
  function is ordered from more complex intrinsic to less complex intrinsics.

  Args:
    comp: Instance of `building_blocks.ComputationBuildingBlock` in which we
      wish to replace all intrinsics with their bodies.
    context_stack: Instance of `context_stack_base.ContextStack`, the context
      stack to use for the bodies of the intrinsics.

  Returns:
    Instance of `building_blocks.ComputationBuildingBlock` with all
    the intrinsics from `intrinsic_bodies.py` inlined with their bodies, along
    with a Boolean indicating whether there was any inlining in fact done.

  Raises:
