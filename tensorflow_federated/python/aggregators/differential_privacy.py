  A DPQuery defines preprocessing to perform on each value, and postprocessing
  to perform on the aggregated, preprocessed values. Provided the preprocessed
  values ("records") are aggregated in a way that is consistent with the
  DPQuery, formal (epsilon, delta) privacy guarantees can be derived. This
  aggregation is controlled by `record_aggregation_factory`.

  A simple summation (using the default `tff.aggregators.SumFactory`) is usually
  acceptable. Aggregations that change the records (such as compression or
  secure aggregation) may be allowed so long as they do not increase the
  sensitivity of the query. It is the users' responsibility to ensure that the
  mode of aggregation is consistent with the DPQuery. Note that the DPQuery's
  built-in aggregation functions (accumulate_preprocessed_record and
  merge_sample_states) are ignored in favor of the provided aggregator.

  The intended use of this method is to call it on each state generated by a

  in this manner. For aggregation processes created by
  DifferentiallyPrivateFactory, initialize() returns a state with a placeholder
  DPEvent. That event is not meant to be used for accounting purposes, so this
  method raises a ValueError if it is called on a state returned from
  initialize().

  Args:
    state: The state output by process.next(), where process is a
      `tff.templates.AggregationProcess` created by
      `DifferentiallyPrivateFactory`.

  Returns:
    A DPEvent corresponding to the DP aggregation that produced this state.

  Raises:
    ExtractingDpEventFromInitialStateError: If the state is the one returned by
      initialize.
