  to perform on the aggregated, preprocessed values. Provided the preprocessed

  DPQuery, formal (epsilon, delta) privacy guarantees can be derived. This
  aggregation is controlled by `record_aggregation_factory`.

  A simple summation (using the default `tff.aggregators.SumFactory`) is usually
  acceptable. Aggregations that change the records (such as compression or
  secure aggregation) may be allowed so long as they do not increase the
  sensitivity of the query. It is the users' responsibility to ensure that the
