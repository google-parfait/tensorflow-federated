  """Applies the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform.

  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Walsh%E2%80%93Hadamard_transform.

  This method uses a composition of existing TensorFlow operations to implement
  the transform.

  The input must be a rank-2 tensor with shape `[a, b]`, where `b` must be a
  power of two, not required to be statically known. The transform will be
  applied for each of the `a` dimensions. That is, the returned tensor y has
  shape `[a, b]` where `y[i, :]` is the product `x[i, :]*H`, where `H` is the
  (normalized) Hadamard matrix.

  Args:
    x: A tensor of shape `[a, b]`.

  Returns:
    A transformed tensor of shape `[a, b]`.

  Raises:
    TensorShapeError: If the input is not rank 2 tensor, or if the second
      dimension is statically known and is not a power of two.
    tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError: If the second dimension is not statically
      known and is not a power of two. Note that in graph execution, this error
      is not raised during the execution of the Python function, but during
      execution of the resulting computation.
