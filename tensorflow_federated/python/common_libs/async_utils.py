class SharedAwaitable():
  """A wrapper allowing `async` functions to be `await`ed from multiple places.

  `async` functions (those that start with `async def`) are typically `await`ed
  immediately at their callsite, as in `await foo()`. However, if users want to
  `await` this value from multiple `async` functions without running `foo()`
  twice, it can be useful to write something like this:

  ```python
  foo_coroutine = foo()

  async def fn_one():
    ...
    x = await foo_coroutine
    ...

  async def fn_two():
    ...
    x = await foo_coroutine
    ...
  ```

  Unfortunately, directly `await`ing the result of an `async` function multiple
  times is not supported, and will fail with an exception:

  `RuntimeError: cannot reuse already awaited coroutine`

  `SharedAwaitable` fixes this problem:

  ```python
  foo_coroutine = SharedAwaitable(foo())

  async def fn_one():
    ...
    x = await foo_coroutine
    ...

  async def fn_two():
    ...
    x = await foo_coroutine
    ...
  ```

  """Class which bridges async and synchronous synchronous interfaces.

  This class serves as a resource and logic container, starting an event loop
  in a separate thread and managing dispatching of coroutine functions to this
  event loop in both synchronous and asynchronous interfaces.

  There are two main uses of this class. First, this class can be used to wrap
  interfaces which use `asyncio` in a synchronous 'run this coroutine'
  interface in a manner which is compatible with integrating with other async
  libraries. This feature is generally useful for backwards-compatibility (e.g.,
  introducing asyncio in some component which sits on top of the synchronous
  function calls this interface exposes), but should generally be viewed as
  suboptimal--it is preferable in a situation like this to simply expose the
  underlying async interfaces.

  Second, this class can be used to delegate asynchronous work from one thread
  to another, using its asynchronous interface.
