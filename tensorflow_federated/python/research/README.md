# TensorFlow Federated Research

This directory contains research projects using TFF that will be used for
research papers.

These research projects are intended to have a dependency on TFF but not other
research projects. Similarly, TFF should not have a dependency on a research
project. Additionally, each research projects may require depndencies that TFF
does not also require; these dependencies should be documented in the README of
the individual research project.

See
[Using TFF for Federated Learning Research](https://github.com/tensorflow/federated/blob/master/docs/tff_for_research.md)
for more information about Federated Learning research in TFF.
