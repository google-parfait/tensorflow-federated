# TensorFlow Federated Research

This directory contains TFF research projects that will be used for research
papers or as canonical examples of how to use TFF.

These research projects are intended to have a dependency on TFF but not other
research projects. Similarly, TFF should not have a dependency on a research
project. Additionally, these research projects may require depndencies that TFF
does not also require; these dependencies should be documented in the README of
the research project.
