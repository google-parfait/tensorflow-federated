  """A simple example of training loop for the Federated Averaging algorithm.

  Args:
    model_fn: A no-arg function that returns a `tff.learning.Model`.
    server_optimizer_fn: A no-arg function that returns a
      `tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer`.
    client_datasets_fn: A function that takes the round number, and returns a
      list of `tf.data.Datset`, one per client.
    total_rounds: Number of rounds to train.
    rounds_per_eval: How often to call the  `metrics_hook` function.
    metrics_hook: A function taking arguments (server_state, train_metrics,
      round_num) and performs evaluation. Optional.
    client_weight_fn: Optional function that takes the output of
      `model.report_local_outputs` and returns a tensor that provides the weight
      in the federated average of model deltas. If not provided, the default is
      the total number of examples processed on device.
    stateful_model_broadcast_fn: A `tff.utils.StatefulBroadcastFn`. (See
      documentation for `tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process`.)
    stateful_delta_aggregate_fn: A `tff.utils.StatefulAggregateFn`. (See
      documentation for `tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process`.)

  Returns:
    Final `ServerState`.
