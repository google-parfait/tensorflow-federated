# Utilities for federated learning research

This directory contains general utilities used by the other directories under
`research/`, for things like writing output, constructing grids of experiments,
configuration via command-line flags, etc.

These utilities are not part of the TFF pip package, and should be considered
experimental. Utilities may be removed or changed at any time.
