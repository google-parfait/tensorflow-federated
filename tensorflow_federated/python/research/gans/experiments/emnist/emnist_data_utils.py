  The preprocessing converts the raw image from [0.0, 1.0] (where 1.0 is
  background) to [-1.0, 1.0] (where -1.0 is background). The range change is in
  order to put the images in a format that's amenable to GAN discriminator
  input. If specified, the image pixel intensities will be inverted (i.e., the
  background will be changed to 1.0).

  The preprocessing also converts the raw label from [0, 61] (where [0, 9] are
  labels for numbers, [10, 35] are labels for uppercase letters, and [36, 61]
  are labels for lowercase letters) to [0, 35] (where [0, 9] are labels for
  numbers and [10, 35] are labels for letters). In other words, the labels are
  converted to be letter case agnostic.

  Args:
    images_ds: The raw EMNIST dataset of OrderedDict elements, to be processed.
    invert_imagery: If True, invert the pixel intensities of the images.
    include_label: If False, the output dataset is only images. If True, the
      output dataset includes labels along with images.
    batch_size: Batch size of output dataset. If None, don't batch.
    shuffle: If True, shuffle the dataset.
    repeat: If True, repeat the dataset.

  Returns:
    A preprocessed, batched, and possibly shuffled/repeated dataset of images
    (and possibly labels).
