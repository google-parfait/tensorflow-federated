  """EMNIST classifier score for evaluating a generative model.

  This is based on the Inception Score, but for an arbitrary classifier.

  This technique is described in detail in https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498. In
  summary, this function calculates

  exp( E[ KL(p(y|x) || p(y)) ] )

  which captures how different the network's classification prediction is from
  the prior distribution over classes.

  This method wraps an implementation of classifier score provided in the
  TF-GAN library (https://github.com/tensorflow/gan). Please see the TF-GAN
  implementation for further details
  (https://github.com/tensorflow/gan/blob/master/tensorflow_gan/python/eval/
  classifier_metrics.py).

  Args:
    images: Images of shape [None, 28, 28, 1] to calculate the classifier score
      for. These images should be preprocessed to the format that is expected by
      the trained classifier model provided via the emnist_classifier argument.
    emnist_classifier: A Keras model instance of a trained EMNIST classifier.
      One is available via the ../classifier/emnist_classifier_model.py library.

  Returns:
    The classifier score. A floating-point scalar.
