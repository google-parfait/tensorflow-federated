r"""Filters EMNIST users' examples to correctly and incorrectly classified sets.

This script applies the image inversion bug to a percentage of the users in the
Federated EMNIST dataset and runs the EMNIST classifier (the `primary model`) on
all users' examples. It then considers two distinct sub-datasets: all user
examples that correctly classified (primary model predicts the correct label)
and all user examples that incorrectly classified (primary model predicts the
wrong label).

It then saves these two sub-datasets so that training can occur without
needing to rerun the EMNIST classifier on all the data each time. Specifically,
for each subpopulation we save two csvs. One is a csv of key/value pairs where
the keys are the Federated EMNIST client IDs and the values are a boolean for
whether the data is inverted or not. The other csv contains key/value pairs
where the key is the client ID and the value is a list (in string form) of
indices of the user's examples that classify correctly or incorrectly.

To run, first build the binary:
  bazel build /path/to/this/script:filter_examples
Then execute it:
  ./path/to/binary/filter_examples --invert_imagery_likelihood=0.1 \
    --min_num_examples=5
