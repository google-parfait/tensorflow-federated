r"""Filter users in Federated EMNIST, based on user example classification.

This script applies the image inversion bug to a percentage of the users in the
Federated EMNIST dataset, runs the EMNIST classifier on all examples from all
users, and computes for each user an overall classification accuracy. It then
identifies whether a user belongs to a subpopulation of 'good' users (i.e., with
accuracy exceeding a cutoff) and whether a user a belongs to a subpopulation of
'bad' users (i.e., with accuracy not meeting a cutoff).

It then saves these two subpopulations so that training can occur without
needing to rerun the EMNIST classifier on all the data each time. Specifically,
for each subpopulation, we save a csv of key/value pairs, where the keys are the
Federated EMNIST client IDs and the values are a boolean for whether the data is
inverted or not.

To run, first build the binary:
  bazel build /path/to/this/script:filter_users
Then execute it:
  ./path/to/binary/filter_users --invert_imagery_likelihood=0.1 \
    --bad_accuracy_cutoff=0.5 --good_accuracy_cutoff=0.9
