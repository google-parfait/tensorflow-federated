  Input data gets filtered on a per-user basis; users get selected via the
  `accuracy_threshold` criterion, and then training can take place with all
  examples from only the selected users.

  Args:
    invert_imagery_probability: The probability that a user\'s image data has
      pixel intensity inverted. E.g., `0p1` corresponds to 0.1, or a 10%
      probability that a user\'s data is flipped. Note that to save time in
      experiment execution, this is precomputed via the ./filter_users.py
      script, and the selection here controls which file to read from.
    accuracy_threshold: Indicates the classification threshold by which a user
      is included in the training population.  E.g., `lt0p882` means any user
      who\'s data cumulatively classifies with <0.882 accuracy would be used for
      training; `gt0p939` means any user who\'s data cumulatively classifies
      with >0.939 accuracy would be used for training. To save time in
      experiment execution, this assignment is precomputed via the
      ./filter_users.py script, and the flag selection here is to indicate which
      file to read from.
    batch_size: Batch size of output dataset. If None, don't batch.
    cache_dir: (Optional) base directory to cache the downloaded files. If None,
      caches in Keras' default cache directory.

  Returns:
    A tff.simulation.ClientData` of real images of numbers/letters. The data has
    been filtered by user classification accuracy as per the input arguments.
