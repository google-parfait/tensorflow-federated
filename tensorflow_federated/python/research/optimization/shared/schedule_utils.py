  """Builds the function for generating client datasets at each round.

  Args:
    train_dataset: A `tff.simulation.ClientData` object.
    clients_per_round: The number of client participants in each round.
    client_batch_size: An integer, the batch size on the clients.
    client_epochs_per_round: An integer, the number of local client epochs.
    total_rounds: The total number of training rounds.
    num_stages: The number of stages in a batch size/client epochs schedule.
    batch_growth_factor: A nonnegative integer specifying how much to increase
      the client batch size at each stage of the schedule. This is done
      multiplicatively, so that batch_growth_factor=1 is a no-op.
    epochs_decrease_amount: A nonnegative integer specifying how much to
      decrease the client epochs at each stage of the schedule. The change is
      performed via subtraction, so that epochs_decrease_amount=0 is a no-op. If
      the number of client epochs is ever nonpositive, it is set to 1.
    shuffle_then_repeat: A boolean. If True, we shuffle then repeat the client
      datasets (which prevents shuffling between epochs).
    shuffle_buffer_size: An integer specifying the buffersize for shuffling a
      `tf.data.Dataset` object.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If batch_growth_factor is not a nonnegative integer.
    ValueError: If epochs_decrease_amount is not a nonnegative integer.

  Returns:
    A function which returns a list of `tff.simulation.ClientData` objects at a
    given round round_num.
