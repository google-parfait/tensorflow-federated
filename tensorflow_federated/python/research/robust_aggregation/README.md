# Robust Federated Aggregation (RFA)

This is a TFF implmentation of the RFA algorithm, a federated learning algorithm
robust to corruptions in client updates. As detailed
[here](https://krishnap25.github.io/papers/2019_rfa.pdf), the robust aggregation
is achieved by computing an approximate Geometric median with the smoothed
Weiszfeld algorithm. See the
[paper](https://krishnap25.github.io/papers/2019_rfa.pdf) for details.

### Use

This directory gives a function `build_robust_federated_aggregation_process`
which builds a federated aggregation process implementing the RFA algorithm. It
works as a drop-in replacement to
`tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process` for vanilla FedAvg. It can be
used in the
[TFF EMIST tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/tutorials/federated_learning_for_image_classification)
as follows:

```
from tensorflow_federated.python.research.robust_aggregation import build_robust_federated_aggregation_process
# dataset setup, model setup, etc. from tutorial
....
# change definition of iterative process from
# iterative_process = tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process(model_fn)
# to
iterative_process = build_robust_federated_aggregation_process(model_fn)
# Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In addition, the directory gives a standalone function
`build_stateless_robust_aggregation` build a robust aggregation oracle as an
instance of `tff.utils.StatefulAggregateFn`.

## Reproducing Experimental Results
