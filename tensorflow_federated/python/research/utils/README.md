# Utilities for federated learning research

This directory contains general utilities used by the other directories under
`research/`. Examples include utiiles for saving checkpoints, writing metrics to
disk, and configuring experiments via command-line flags. For examples of
federated learning experiments using these utilities, see the
[`research/optimization`](https://github.com/tensorflow/federated/blob/master/tensorflow_federated/python/research/optimization)
directory.

These utilities are not part of the TFF pip package, and should be considered
experimental. Utilities may be removed or changed at any time.
