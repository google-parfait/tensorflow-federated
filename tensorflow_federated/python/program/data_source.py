  * Determine the type of the data supplied by this iterator by inspecting
    the `federated_type` property. The type returned must match that of the data
    source that returned this iterator.

  * Return a new selection of federated data from the iterator by invoking
    `select`.

  Please see `tff.program.FederatedDataSource` for additional context and the
