  """A `tff.program.ReleaseManager` that filters values before releasing them.

  A `tff.program.FilteringReleaseManager` is a utility for filtering values
  before releasing the values and is used to release values from platform
  storage to customer storage in a federated program.

  Values are filtered using a `filter_fn` and released to the `release_manager`.

  The `filter_fn` is a `Callable` that has a single parameter `path` and returns
  a `bool`, and is used to filter values before they are released. A `path` is a
  tuple of indices and/or keys which uniquely identifies the position of the
  corresponding item in the `value`; `path` matches the expectations of the
  `tree` library.

  The `filter_fn` is applied to the items in the structure but not the structure
  itself. If all the items in a structure are filtered out, then the structure
  will be filtered out as well.

  For example:

  ```
  filtering_manager = tff.program.FilteringReleaseManager(
      release_manager=...,
      filter_fn=...,
  )

  value = {
    'loss': 1.0,
    'accuracy': 0.5,
  }
  await filtering_manager.release(value, ...)
  ```

  If `filter_fn` is:

  * `lambda _: True` then the entire structure is released.
  * `lambda _: False` then nothing is released.
  * `lambda path: path == ('loss',)` then `{'loss': 1.0}` is released.

  Note: The path `()` corresponds to the root of the structure; because the
  `filter_fn` is applied to the items in the structure but not the structure
  itself, this path can be used to filter individual values from structures of
  values.

  Important: Most `tff.program.ReleasableStructure` can be filtered, including
  individual values, structures, and structures nested in `NamedTuple`s.
  However, the fields of a `NamedTuple` cannot be filtered.
