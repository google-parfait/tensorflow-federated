# TensorFlow Federated End-To-End Tests

This directory contains end-to-end tests of the TFF Python package.

These tests operate at a high level; use the TFF API; and are intended to verify
that the package as a whole is working. These test are expected to excercise any
or all of the modules in the TFF package and may make use of external resources
such as databases, files systems, and network services.
