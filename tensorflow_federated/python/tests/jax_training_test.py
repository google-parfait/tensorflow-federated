"""End-to-end test of training in JAX.

This test is still evolving. Eventually, it should do federated training, run
with a model of sufficient complexity, etc., and morph into a form that we could
consider moving out of experimental and capturing in a tutorial. For the time
beingm, this test is here to ensure that we don't break JAX support as we evolve
it to be more complete and feature-full.
