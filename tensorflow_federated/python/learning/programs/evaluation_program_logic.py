"""Program logic for evaluating federated learning.

This package contains program logic and abstractions for
managing federated model evaluation. It exposed two symbols:

*   `EvaluationManager` which manages "forking off" side evaluation loops that
    run the evaluation loop for a duration of time based on the
    `evaluation_period` parameter. It keeps track of evaluation state enabling
    resumption of evaluations in the case the program exits prematurely.
*   `run_evaluation` which is the program logic for a single evaluation loop.

This logic is intended to be paired with another set of program logic that
produces model weights to evaluate, typically a training program. For example
if a program is configured to evaluate every other training round for two
evalution rounds, the sequence may look something like this:

```
   ┌────────┐  ┌──────────┐        ┌──────────┐
   │Training│  │Evaluation│        │Evaluation│
   └───┬────┘  └───┬──────┘        └───┬──────┘
       │           │                   │
       │──┐        │                   │
       │ Round 1   │                   │
       │<─┘        │                   │
       │──┐        │                   │
       │ Round 2──>│                   │
       │<─┘        │──┐                │
       │──┐        │  │ Eval Round 1   │
       │ Round 3   │<─┘                │
       │<─┘        │──┐                │
       │──┐        │  │ Eval Round 2   │
       │ Round 4──────────────────────>│
       │<─┘        │<─┘                │──┐
       │──┐        │                   │  │ Eval Round 1
       │ Round 5   │                   │<─┘
       │<─┘        │                   │──┐
       │──┐        │                   │  │ Eval Round 2
       │ Round 6────────────────────────────────────────────>
       │<─┘        │                   │<─┘
       ...
```

Where the Evaluation sequences are managed by the `EvaluationManager`.

Note: "Eval Round N" is output as `Training Round + Eval Round - 1`. This way
the first evaluation round for an evaluation loop will align on the x-axis with
the training round that provides the checkpoint that is being evaluated.

  This manager performs three responsbilities:

  1.  Prepares, starts and tracks new evaluation loops. This involves creating
      a new evaluation process and state manager for that process, adding
      the new process to the list of tracked inprocess evaluations, and
      creating a new `asyncio.Task` to run the evaluation loop.
  2.  Record evaluations that have finished. This removes the evaluation from
      the list of in-progresss evaluations.
  3.  If the program has restarted, load the most recent state of in-progress
      evaluations and restart each of the evaluations.

  This class uses N + 1 `tff.program.ProgramStateManagers` to enable resumable
  evaluations.

  *   The first state managers is for this class itself, and manages the list of
      in-progress evaluations via two tensor objects. Tensor objects must be
      used (rather than Python lists) because
      `tff.program.FileProgramStateManager` does not support state objects that
      change Python _structure_ across versions (e.g. to load the next version,
      we must known its shape, but after a restart we don't know).
      Alternatively, we can use tensor or ndarray objects with shape `[None]` to
      support changing shapes of structure's leaf elements.
  *   The next N state managers manage the cross-round metric aggregation for
      each evaluation process started. One for each evaluation process.
