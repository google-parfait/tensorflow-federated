"""Libraries for building federated learning algorithms.

Currently, `tff.learning` provides a few types of functionality.

*   Algorithmic building blocks (see `tff.learning.templates`)
    for constructing federated learning algorithms. These are algorithms
    centered around the client work, server work, broadcast, or aggregation
    steps of a federated algorithms, and are intended to compose in a somewhat
    modular fashion.
*   End-to-end federated learning algorithms (such as
    `tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process`) that combine broadcast,
    client work, aggregation, and server update logic into a single algorithm
    (often by composing the building blocks discussed above). This library also
    provides end-to-end algorithms for federated evaluation (see
    `tff.learning.build_federated_evaluation`).
*   Functionality supporting the development of the algorithms above. This
    includes `tff.learning.optimizers`, `tff.learning.metrics` and recommended
    aggregators, such as `tff.learning.robust_aggregator`.

The library also contains classes of models that are used for the purposes of
model training. See `tff.learning.Model` for the overall base class, and
`tff.learning.models` for related model classes.
