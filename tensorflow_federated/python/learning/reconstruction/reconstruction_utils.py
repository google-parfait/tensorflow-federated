# Type alias for a function that takes in a TF dataset and produces two TF
# datasets. This is consumed by training and evaluation computation builders.
# The first is iterated over during reconstruction and the second is iterated
# over post-reconstruction, for both training and evaluation. This can be useful
# for e.g. splitting the dataset into disjoint halves for each stage, doing
# multiple local epochs of reconstruction/training, skipping reconstruction
# entirely, etc. See `build_dataset_split_fn` for a builder, although users can
# also specify their own `DatasetSplitFn`s (see `simple_dataset_split_fn` for an
# example).

  exactly the same data in the same order for both reconstruction and
  post-reconstruction. For example, if
  `client_dataset.shuffle(reshuffle_each_iteration=True)` was applied,
  post-reconstruction data will be in a different order than reconstruction
  data.

  Returned `DatasetSplitFn` parameterizes training and evaluation computations
  and enables reconstruction for multiple local epochs, multiple epochs of
  post-reconstruction training, limiting the number of steps for both stages,
  and splitting client datasets into disjoint halves for each stage.

  Note that the returned function is used during both training and evaluation:
  during training, "post-reconstruction" refers to training of global variables,
  and during evaluation, it refers to calculation of metrics using reconstructed
  local variables and fixed global variables.

  Args:
    recon_epochs: The integer number of iterations over the dataset to make
      during reconstruction.
    recon_steps_max: If not None, the integer maximum number of steps (batches)
      to iterate through during reconstruction. This maximum number of steps is
      across all reconstruction iterations, i.e. it is applied after
      `recon_epochs`. If None, this has no effect.
    post_recon_epochs: The integer constant number of iterations to make over
      client data after reconstruction.
    post_recon_steps_max: If not None, the integer maximum number of steps
      (batches) to iterate through after reconstruction. This maximum number of
      steps is across all post-reconstruction iterations, i.e. it is applied
      after `post_recon_epochs`. If None, this has no effect.
    split_dataset: If True, splits `client_dataset` in half for each user, using
      even-indexed entries in reconstruction and odd-indexed entries after
      reconstruction. If False, `client_dataset` is used for both reconstruction
      and post-reconstruction, with the above arguments applied. If True,
      splitting requires that mupltiple iterations through the dataset yield the
      same ordering. For example if
      `client_dataset.shuffle(reshuffle_each_iteration=True)` has been called,
      then the split datasets may have overlap. If True, note that the dataset
      should have more than one batch for reasonable results, since the
      splitting does not occur within batches.

  Returns:
    A `SplitDatasetFn`.
