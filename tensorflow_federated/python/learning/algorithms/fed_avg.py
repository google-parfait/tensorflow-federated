  """Builds a learning process that performs federated averaging.

  This function creates a `tff.learning.templates.LearningProcess` that performs
  federated averaging on client models. The iterative process has the following
  methods inherited from `tff.learning.templates.LearningProcess`:

  *   `initialize`: A `tff.Computation` with the functional type signature
      `( -> S@SERVER)`, where `S` is a
      `tff.learning.templates.LearningAlgorithmState` representing the initial
      state of the server.
  *   `next`: A `tff.Computation` with the functional type signature
      `(<S@SERVER, {B*}@CLIENTS> -> <L@SERVER>)` where `S` is a
      `tff.learning.templates.LearningAlgorithmState` whose type matches the
      output of `initialize` and `{B*}@CLIENTS` represents the client datasets.
      The output `L` contains the updated server state, as well as aggregated
      metrics at the server, including client training metrics and any other
      metrics from distribution and aggregation processes.
  *   `get_model_weights`: A `tff.Computation` with type signature `(S -> M)`,
      where `S` is a `tff.learning.templates.LearningAlgorithmState` whose type
      matches the output of `initialize` and `next`, and `M` represents the type
      of the model weights used during training.
  *   `set_model_weights`: A `tff.Computation` with type signature
      `(<S, M> -> S)`, where `S` is a
      `tff.learning.templates.LearningAlgorithmState` whose type matches the
      output of `initialize` and `M` represents the type of the model weights
      used during training.

  Each time the `next` method is called, the server model is communicated to
  each client using the provided `model_distributor`. For each client, local
  training is performed using `client_optimizer_fn`. Each client computes the
  difference between the client model after training and its initial model.
  These model deltas are then aggregated at the server using a weighted
  aggregation function, according to `client_weighting`. The aggregate model
  delta is applied at the server using a server optimizer.

  Note: the default server optimizer function is `tf.keras.optimizers.SGD`
  with a learning rate of 1.0, which corresponds to adding the model delta to
  the current server model. This recovers the original FedAvg algorithm in
  [McMahan et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629). More
  sophisticated federated averaging procedures may use different learning rates
  or server optimizers (this generalized FedAvg algorithm is described in
  [Reddi et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00295)).

  Args:
    model_fn: A no-arg function that returns a `tff.learning.Model`. This method
      must *not* capture TensorFlow tensors or variables and use them. The model
      must be constructed entirely from scratch on each invocation, returning
      the same pre-constructed model each call will result in an error. Cannot
      be used with `model` argument.
    client_optimizer_fn: A `tff.learning.optimizers.Optimizer`, or a no-arg
      callable that returns a `tf.keras.Optimizer`.
    server_optimizer_fn: A `tff.learning.optimizers.Optimizer`, or a no-arg
      callable that returns a `tf.keras.Optimizer`. By default, this uses
      `tf.keras.optimizers.SGD` with a learning rate of 1.0.
    client_weighting: A member of `tff.learning.ClientWeighting` that specifies
      a built-in weighting method. By default, weighting by number of examples
      is used.
    model_distributor: An optional `DistributionProcess` that distributes the
      model weights on the server to the clients. If set to `None`, the
      distributor is constructed via `distributors.build_broadcast_process`.
    model_aggregator: An optional `tff.aggregators.WeightedAggregationFactory`
      used to aggregate client updates on the server. If `None`, this is set to
      `tff.aggregators.MeanFactory`.
    metrics_aggregator: A function that takes in the metric finalizers (i.e.,
      `tff.learning.Model.metric_finalizers()`) and a
      `tff.types.StructWithPythonType` of the unfinalized metrics (i.e., the TFF
      type of `tff.learning.Model.report_local_unfinalized_metrics()`), and
      returns a `tff.Computation` for aggregating the unfinalized metrics. If
      `None`, this is set to `tff.learning.metrics.sum_then_finalize`.
    use_experimental_simulation_loop: Controls the reduce loop function for
      input dataset. An experimental reduce loop is used for simulation. It is
      currently necessary to set this flag to True for performant GPU
      simulations.
    model: A `tff.learning.models.FunctionalModel` to train. Cannot be used with
      `model_fn` and must be `None` if `model_fn` is not `None`.

  Returns:
    A `tff.learning.templates.LearningProcess`.
