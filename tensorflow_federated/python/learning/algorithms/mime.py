  This function creates a `tff.learning.templates.LearningProcess` that performs
  Mime Lite algorithm on client models. The iterative process has the following
  methods inherited from `tff.learning.templates.LearningProcess`:

  *   `initialize`: A `tff.Computation` with the functional type signature
      `( -> S@SERVER)`, where `S` is a
      `tff.learning.templates.LearningAlgorithmState` representing the initial
      state of the server.
  *   `next`: A `tff.Computation` with the functional type signature
      `(<S@SERVER, {B*}@CLIENTS> -> <L@SERVER>)` where `S` is a
      `tff.learning.templates.LearningAlgorithmState` whose type matches the
      output of `initialize` and `{B*}@CLIENTS` represents the client datasets.
      The output `L` contains the updated server state, as well as aggregated
      metrics at the server, including client training metrics and any other
      metrics from distribution and aggregation processes.
  *   `get_model_weights`: A `tff.Computation` with type signature `(S -> M)`,
      where `S` is a `tff.learning.templates.LearningAlgorithmState` whose type
      matches the output of `initialize` and `next`, and `M` represents the type
      of the model weights used during training.
  *   `set_model_weights`: A `tff.Computation` with type signature
      `(<S, M> -> S)`, where `S` is a
      `tff.learning.templates.LearningAlgorithmState` whose type matches the
      output of `initialize` and `M` represents the type of the model weights
      used during training.

  Each time the `next` method is called, the server model is communicated to
  each client using the provided `model_distributor`. For each client, local
  training is performed using `optimizer`, where its state is communicated by
  the server, and kept intact during local training. The state is updated only
  at the server based on the full gradient evaluated by the clients based on the
  current server model state. The client full gradients are aggregated by
  weighted `full_gradient_aggregator`. Each client computes the difference
  between the client model after training and its initial model. These model
  deltas are then aggregated by weighted `model_aggregator`. Both of the
  aggregations are weighted, according to `client_weighting`. The aggregate
  model delta is added to the existing server model state.

  The Mime Lite algorithm is based on the paper
  "Breaking the centralized barrier for cross-device federated learning."
    Sai Praneeth Karimireddy, Martin Jaggi, Satyen Kale, Mehryar Mohri, Sashank
    Reddi, Sebastian U. Stich, and Ananda Theertha Suresh.

  Note that Keras optimizers are not supported. This is due to the Mime Lite
  algorithm applying the optimizer without changing it state at clients
  (optimizer's `tf.Variable`s in the case of Keras), which is not possible with
  Keras optimizers without reaching into private implementation details and
  incurring additional computation and memory cost at clients.

      must *not* capture TensorFlow tensors or variables and use them. The model

      for applying the aggregate model update to the global model weights.
    client_weighting: A member of `tff.learning.ClientWeighting` that specifies
      a built-in weighting method. By default, weighting by number of examples
      is used.
    model_distributor: An optional `DistributionProcess` that distributes the
      model weights on the server to the clients. If set to `None`, the
      distributor is constructed via `distributors.build_broadcast_process`.
    model_aggregator: An optional `tff.aggregators.WeightedAggregationFactory`
      used to aggregate client updates on the server. If `None`, this is set to

      of the model weights used during training.
  *   `set_model_weights`: A `tff.Computation` with type signature
      `(<S, M> -> S)`, where `S` is a
      `tff.learning.templates.LearningAlgorithmState` whose type matches the
      output of `initialize` and `M` represents the type of the model weights
      used during training.

  Each time the `next` method is called, the server model is communicated to
  each client using the provided `model_distributor`. For each client, local
  training is performed using `optimizer`, where its state is communicated by
  the server, and kept intact during local training. The state is updated only
  at the server based on the full gradient evaluated by the clients based on the
  current server model state. The client full gradients are aggregated by
  unweighted `full_gradient_aggregator`. Each client computes the difference
  between the client model after training and its initial model. These model
  deltas are then aggregated by unweighted `model_aggregator`. The aggregate
  model delta is added to the existing server model state.

  The Mime Lite algorithm is based on the paper

  Note that Keras optimizers are not supported. This is due to the Mime Lite
  algorithm applying the optimizer without changing it state at clients
  (optimizer's `tf.Variable`s in the case of Keras), which is not possible with
  Keras optimizers without reaching into private implementation details and
  incurring additional computation and memory cost at clients.

  Args:
    model_fn: A no-arg function that returns a `tff.learning.Model`. This method
      must *not* capture TensorFlow tensors or variables and use them. The model
      must be constructed entirely from scratch on each invocation, returning
      the same pre-constructed model each call will result in an error.
    base_optimizer: A `tff.learning.optimizers.Optimizer` which will be used for
      both creating and updating a global optimizer state, as well as
      optimization at clients given the global state, which is fixed during the
      optimization.
    server_optimizer: A `tff.learning.optimizers.Optimizer` which will be used
      for applying the aggregate model update to the global model weights.
    model_distributor: An optional `DistributionProcess` that distributes the
      model weights on the server to the clients. If set to `None`, the
      distributor is constructed via `distributors.build_broadcast_process`.
    model_aggregator: An optional `tff.aggregators.UnweightedAggregationFactory`
      used to aggregate client updates on the server. If `None`, this is set to
      `tff.aggregators.UnweightedMeanFactory`.
    full_gradient_aggregator: An optional
      `tff.aggregators.UnweightedAggregationFactory` used to aggregate the full
      gradients on client datasets. If `None`, this is set to
      `tff.aggregators.UnweightedMeanFactory`.
    metrics_aggregator: A function that takes in the metric finalizers (i.e.,
      `tff.learning.Model.metric_finalizers()`) and a
      `tff.types.StructWithPythonType` of the unfinalized metrics (i.e., the TFF
      type of `tff.learning.Model.report_local_unfinalized_metrics()`), and
      returns a `tff.Computation` for aggregating the unfinalized metrics. If
      `None`, this is set to `tff.learning.metrics.sum_then_finalize`.
    use_experimental_simulation_loop: Controls the reduce loop function for
      input dataset. An experimental reduce loop is used for simulation. It is
      currently necessary to set this flag to True for performant GPU
      simulations.

  Returns:
    A `tff.learning.templates.LearningProcess`.
