  """Builds a learning process that performs the FedProx algorithm.

  This function creates a `tff.learning.templates.LearningProcess` that performs
  example-weighted FedProx on client models. This algorithm behaves the same as
  federated averaging, except that it uses a proximal regularization term that
  encourages clients to not drift too far from the server model.

  The iterative process has the following methods inherited from
  `tff.learning.templates.LearningProcess`:

  *   `initialize`: A `tff.Computation` with the functional type signature
      `( -> S@SERVER)`, where `S` is a
      `tff.learning.templates.LearningAlgorithmState` representing the initial
      state of the server.
  *   `next`: A `tff.Computation` with the functional type signature
      `(<S@SERVER, {B*}@CLIENTS> -> <L@SERVER>)` where `S` is a
      `tff.learning.templates.LearningAlgorithmState` whose type matches the
      output of `initialize`and `{B*}@CLIENTS` represents the client datasets.
      The output `L` contains the updated server state, as well as aggregated
      metrics at the server, including client training metrics and any other
      metrics from distribution and aggregation processes.
  *   `get_model_weights`: A `tff.Computation` with type signature `(S -> M)`,
      where `S` is a `tff.learning.templates.LearningAlgorithmState` whose type
      matches the output of `initialize` and `M` represents the type of the
      model weights used during training.

  Each time the `next` method is called, the server model is communicated to
  each client using the provided `model_distributor`. For each client, local
  training is performed using `client_optimizer_fn`. Each client computes the
  difference between the client model after training and the initial model.
  These model deltas are then aggregated at the server using a weighted
  aggregation function, according to `client_weighting`. The aggregate model
  delta is applied at the server using a server optimizer, as in the FedOpt
  framework proposed in [Reddi et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00295).

  Note: The default server optimizer function is `tf.keras.optimizers.SGD`
  with a learning rate of 1.0, which corresponds to adding the model delta to
  the current server model. This recovers the original FedProx algorithm in
  [Li et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06127). More
  sophisticated federated averaging procedures may use different learning rates
  or server optimizers.

  Args:
    model_fn: A no-arg function that returns a `tff.learning.Model`. This method
      must *not* capture TensorFlow tensors or variables and use them. The model
      must be constructed entirely from scratch on each invocation, returning
      the same pre-constructed model each call will result in an error.
    proximal_strength: A nonnegative float representing the parameter of
      FedProx's regularization term. When set to `0`, the algorithm reduces to
      FedAvg. Higher values prevent clients from moving too far from the server
      model during local training.
    client_optimizer_fn: A `tff.learning.optimizers.Optimizer`, or a no-arg
      callable that returns a `tf.keras.Optimizer`.
    server_optimizer_fn: A `tff.learning.optimizers.Optimizer`, or a no-arg
      callable that returns a `tf.keras.Optimizer`. By default, this uses
      `tf.keras.optimizers.SGD` with a learning rate of 1.0.
    client_weighting: A member of `tff.learning.ClientWeighting` that specifies
      a built-in weighting method. By default, weighting by number of examples
      is used.
    model_distributor: An optional `DistributionProcess` that broadcasts the
      model weights on the server to the clients. If set to `None`, the
      distributor is constructed via `distributors.build_broadcast_process`.
    model_aggregator: An optional `tff.aggregators.WeightedAggregationFactory`
      used to aggregate client updates on the server. If `None`, this is set to
      `tff.aggregators.MeanFactory`.
    metrics_aggregator: A function that takes in the metric finalizers (i.e.,
      `tff.learning.Model.metric_finalizers()`) and a
      `tff.types.StructWithPythonType` of the unfinalized metrics (i.e., the TFF
      type of `tff.learning.Model.report_local_unfinalized_metrics()`), and
      returns a `tff.Computation` for aggregating the unfinalized metrics. If
      `None`, this is set to `tff.learning.metrics.sum_then_finalize`.
    use_experimental_simulation_loop: Controls the reduce loop function for
      input dataset. An experimental reduce loop is used for simulation. It is
      currently necessary to set this flag to True for performant GPU
      simulations.

    A `tff.learning.templates.LearningProcess`.
