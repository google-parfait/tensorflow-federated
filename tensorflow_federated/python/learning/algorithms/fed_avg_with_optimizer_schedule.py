  """Builds a learning process for FedAvg with client optimizer scheduling.

  This function creates a `LearningProcess` that performs federated averaging on
  client models. The iterative process has the following methods inherited from
  `LearningProcess`:

  *   `initialize`: A `tff.Computation` with the functional type signature
      `( -> S@SERVER)`, where `S` is a `LearningAlgorithmState` representing the
      initial state of the server.
  *   `next`: A `tff.Computation` with the functional type signature
      `(<S@SERVER, {B*}@CLIENTS> -> <L@SERVER>)` where `S` is a
      `tff.learning.templates.LearningAlgorithmState` whose type matches the
      output of `initialize` and `{B*}@CLIENTS` represents the client datasets.
      The output `L` contains the updated server state, as well as aggregated
      metrics at the server, including client training metrics and any other
      metrics from distribution and aggregation processes.
  *   `get_model_weights`: A `tff.Computation` with type signature `(S -> M)`,
      where `S` is a `tff.learning.templates.LearningAlgorithmState` whose type
      matches the output of `initialize` and `M` represents the type of the
      model weights used during training.

  Each time the `next` method is called, the server model is broadcast to each
  client using a broadcast function. For each client, local training is
  performed using `client_optimizer_fn`. Each client computes the difference
  between the client model after training and the initial broadcast model.
  These model deltas are then aggregated at the server using a weighted
  aggregation function. Clients weighted by the number of examples they see
  thoughout local training. The aggregate model delta is applied at the server
  using a server optimizer.

  The primary purpose of this implementation of FedAvg is that it allows for the
  client optimizer to be scheduled across rounds. The process keeps track of how
  many iterations of `.next` have occurred (starting at `0`), and for each such
  `round_num`, the clients will use `client_optimizer_fn(round_num)` to perform
  local optimization. This allows learning rate scheduling (eg. starting with
  a large learning rate and decaying it over time) as well as a small learning
  rate (eg. switching optimizers as learning progresses).

  Note: the default server optimizer function is `tf.keras.optimizers.SGD`
  with a learning rate of 1.0, which corresponds to adding the model delta to
  the current server model. This recovers the original FedAvg algorithm in
  [McMahan et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629). More
  sophisticated federated averaging procedures may use different learning rates
  or server optimizers.

  Args:
    model_fn: A no-arg function that returns a `tff.learning.Model`. This method
      must *not* capture TensorFlow tensors or variables and use them. The model
      must be constructed entirely from scratch on each invocation, returning
      the same pre-constructed model each call will result in an error.
    client_learning_rate_fn: A callable accepting an integer round number and
      returning a float to be used as a learning rate for the optimizer. The
      client work will call `optimizer_fn(learning_rate_fn(round_num))` where
      `round_num` is the integer round number. Note that the round numbers
      supplied will start at `0` and increment by one each time `.next` is
      called on the resulting process. Also note that this function must be
      serializable by TFF.
    client_optimizer_fn: A callable accepting a float learning rate, and
      returning a `tff.learning.optimizers.Optimizer` or a `tf.keras.Optimizer`.
    server_optimizer_fn: A `tff.learning.optimizers.Optimizer`, or a no-arg
      callable that returns a `tf.keras.Optimizer`. By default, this uses
      `tf.keras.optimizers.SGD` with a learning rate of 1.0.
    model_distributor: An optional `DistributionProcess` that distributes the
      model weights on the server to the clients. If set to `None`, the
      distributor is constructed via `distributors.build_broadcast_process`.
    model_aggregator: An optional `tff.aggregators.WeightedAggregationFactory`
      used to aggregate client updates on the server. If `None`, this is set to
      `tff.aggregators.MeanFactory`.
    metrics_aggregator: A function that takes in the metric finalizers (i.e.,
      `tff.learning.Model.metric_finalizers()`) and a
      `tff.types.StructWithPythonType` of the unfinalized metrics (i.e., the TFF
      type of `tff.learning.Model.report_local_unfinalized_metrics()`), and
      returns a `tff.Computation` for aggregating the unfinalized metrics. If
      `None`, this is set to `tff.learning.metrics.sum_then_finalize`.
    use_experimental_simulation_loop: Controls the reduce loop function for
      input dataset. An experimental reduce loop is used for simulation. It is
      currently necessary to set this flag to True for performant GPU
      simulations.

  Returns:
    A `LearningProcess`.
