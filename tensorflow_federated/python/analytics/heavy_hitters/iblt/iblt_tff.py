  """Builds the `tff.Computation` for heavy-hitters discovery with IBLT.

  Args:
    capacity: The capacity of the IBLT sketch. Defaults to `1000`.
    max_string_length: The maximum length of a string in the IBLT. Defaults to
      `10`. Must be positive.
    repetitions: The number of repetitions in IBLT data structure (must be >=
      3). Defaults to `3`. Must be at least `3`.
    seed: An integer seed for hash functions. Defaults to `0`.
    max_heavy_hitters: The maximum number of items to return. If the decoded
      results have more than this number of items, will order decreasingly by
      the estimated counts and return the top max_heavy_hitters items. Default
      max_heavy_hitters == `None`, which means to return all the heavy hitters
      in the result.
    max_words_per_user: The maximum number of words each client is allowed to
      contribute. If not `None`, must be a positive integer. Defaults to `None`,
      which means all the clients contribute all their words.
    k_anonymity: Only return words that appear in at least k clients. Must be a
      positive integer. Defaults to `1`.
    secure_sum_bitwidth: The bitwidth used for secure sum. The default value is
      `None`, which disables secure sum. If not `None`, must be in the range
      `[1,62]`. See `tff.federated_secure_sum_bitwidth`.
    batch_size: The number of elements in each batch of the dataset.  Defaults
      to `1`, means the input dataset is processed by
      `tf.data.Dataset.batch(1)`.  Must be a positive.
    multi_contribution: Whether each client is allowed to contribute multiple
      counts or only a count of one for each unique word. Defaults to `True`.
    string_postprocessor: A callable function that is run after strings are
      decoded from the IBLT in order to postprocess them. It should accept a
      single string tensor and output a single string tensor of the same shape.
      If `None`, no postprocessing is done.
    decode_iblt_fn: A function to decode key-value pairs from an IBLT sketch.
      Defaults to `None`, in this case `decode_iblt_fn` will be set to
      `iblt.decode_iblt_tf`.

  Returns:
    A `tff.Computation` that performs federated heavy hitter discovery.

  Raises:
    ValueError: if parameters don't meet expectations.
