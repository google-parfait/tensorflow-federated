The ability to use serialized models makes it easy to mix federated learning with other ML approaches. Further, this allows use of an increasing range of pre-trained models --- for example, training language models from scratch is rarely necessary, as numerous pre-trained models are now widely available (see, e.g., [TF Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub)). Instead, it makes more sense to start from a pre-trained model, and refine it using Federated Learning, adapting to the particular characteristics of the decentralized data for a particular application.\n",
