The ability to use serialized models makes it easy to mix federated learning with other ML approaches. Further, this allows use of an increasing range of pre-trained models --- for example, training language models from scratch is rarely necessary, as numerous pre-trained models are now widely available (see, e.g., [TF Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub)). Instead, it makes more sense to start from a pre-trained model, and refine it using Federated Learning, adapting to the particular characteristics of the decentralized data for a particular application.\n",

        "  * Use \"`.repeat(NUM_EPOCHS)`\" on the client datasets to try multiple epochs of local training (e.g., as in [McMahan et. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629)). See also [Federated Learning for Image Classification](federated_learning_for_image_classification.ipynb) which does this.\n",
        "  * Change the `compile()` command to experiment with using different optimization algorithms on the client.\n",
        "  * Try the `server_optimizer` argument to `build_federated_averaging_process` to try different algorithms for applying the model updates on the server.\n",
        "  * Try the `client_weight_fn` argument to to `build_federated_averaging_process` to try different weightings of the clients. The default weights client updates by the number of examples on the client, but you can do e.g. `client_weight_fn=lambda _: tf.constant(1.0)`."
