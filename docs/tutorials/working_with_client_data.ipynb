TFF provides the interface [`tff.simulation.datasets.ClientData`](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/simulation/datasets/ClientData) to abstract over this concept, and the datasets which TFF hosts ([stackoverflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/simulation/datasets/stackoverflow), [shakespeare](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/simulation/datasets/shakespeare), [emnist](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/simulation/datasets/emnist), [cifar100](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/simulation/datasets/cifar100), and [gldv2](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/simulation/datasets/gldv2)) all implement this interface.\n",

Further, the `tf.data.Datasets` which `ClientData` constructs can be iterated over directly to yield structures of `numpy` arrays, so `ClientData` objects can be used with any Python-based ML framework before moving to TFF.\n",

        "\n",
        "To avoid this issue, TFF recommends its users to consider dataset instantiation and preprocessing as *something that happens locally on each client*, and to use TFF's helpers or `federated_map` to explicitly run this preprocessing code at each client.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conceptually, the reason for preferring this is clear: in TFF's local runtime, the clients only \"accidentally\" have access to the global Python environment due to the fact that the entire federated orchestration is happening on a single machine. It is worthwhile noting at this point that similar thinking gives rise to TFF's cross-platform, always-serializable, functional philosophy.\n",
