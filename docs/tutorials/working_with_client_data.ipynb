TFF provides the interface [`tff.simulation.datasets.ClientData`](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/simulation/datasets/ClientData) to abstract over this concept, and the datasets which TFF hosts ([stackoverflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/simulation/datasets/stackoverflow), [shakespeare](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/simulation/datasets/shakespeare), [emnist](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/simulation/datasets/emnist), [cifar100](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/simulation/datasets/cifar100), and [gldv2](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/simulation/datasets/gldv2)) all implement this interface.\n",
