        "Consider the following setting: Each client has a list of strings, and each string is from an open set, which means it could be arbitrary. The goal is to discover the most popular strings (**heavy hitters**) and their counts privately in a federated setting. This colab demonstrates a solution to this problem with the following privacy properties:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Secure aggregation: Computes the aggregated string counts such that it should not be possible for the server to learn any client's individual value. See `tff.federated_secure_sum` for more information.\n",
        "*   Differential pirvacy (DP): A widely used method for bounding and quantifying the privacy leakage of sensitive data in analytics. You can apply user-level central DP to the heavy hitter results. \n",
        "\n",
        "The secure aggregation API `tff.federated_secure_sum` supports linear sums of integer vectors. If the strings are from a closed set of size `n`, then it is easy to encode each client's strings to a vector of size `n`: let the value at index `i` of the vector be the count of the `i`<sup>th</sup> string in the closed set. Then you can securely sum the vectors of all clients to get the counts of strings in the whole population. However, if the strings are from an open set, it is not obvious how to encode them properly for secure sum. In this work, you can encode the strings into [Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.2245), which is a probabilistic data structure that have the ability to encode items in a large (or open) domain in an efficient manner. IBLT sketches can be linearly summed, so they are compatible with secure sum.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use `tff.analytics.heavy_hitters.iblt.build_iblt_computation` to create a TFF computation that encodes each client's local strings to an IBLT structure. These structures are securely summed via a cryptographic secure multi-party computation protocol into an aggregated IBLT structure which the server can decode. The server then can return the top heavy hitters. The following sections show how to use this API to create a TFF computation and run simulations with the Shakespeare dataset. "
