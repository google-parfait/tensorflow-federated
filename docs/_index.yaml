      description: >
        <p>Federated Learning (FL) is the approach of training a shared global
        model under the coordination of a central server, from a federation of
        participating devices which maintain control of their own data.</p>
        <p>Federated Learning enables mobile phones to collaboratively learn a
        shared prediction model while keeping all the training data on device,
        decoupling the ability to do machine learning from the need to store the
        data in the cloud. This goes beyond the use of local models that make
        predictions on mobile devices by bringing model training to the device as well.</p>
