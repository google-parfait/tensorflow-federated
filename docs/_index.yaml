          <p>TensorFlow Federated (TFF) is an open-source framework for machine learning and other
          computations on decentralized data. TFF has been developed to facilitate open research and
          experimentation with
          <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html" class="external">Federated Learning (FL)</a>,
          an approach to machine learning where a shared global model is trained across many
          participating clients that keep their training data locally. For example, FL has been used
          to train
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03604" class="external">prediction models for mobile keyboards</a>
          without uploading sensitive typing data to servers.</p>
          <p>TFF enables developers to simulate the included federated learning algorithms on their
          models and data, as well as to experiment with novel algorithms. Researchers will find
          <a href="/federated/tff_for_research.md">starting points and complete examples</a>
          for many kinds of research. The building blocks
          provided by TFF can also be used to implement non-learning computations, such
          as <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/05/federated-analytics-collaborative-data.html">federated analytics</a>.
          TFF’s interfaces are organized in two main layers:</p>
      - heading: Federated Learning (FL) API
        description: >
          This layer offers a set of high-level interfaces that allow developers to apply the
          included implementations of federated training and evaluation to their existing
          TensorFlow models.

      - heading: Federated Core (FC) API
        description: >
          At the core of the system is a set of lower-level interfaces for concisely expressing
          novel federated algorithms by combining TensorFlow with distributed communication
          operators within a strongly-typed functional programming environment. This layer also
          serves as the foundation upon which we've built Federated Learning.

          <p>TFF enables developers to declaratively express federated computations, so they could be
          deployed to diverse runtime environments. Included with TFF is a performant multi-machine
          simulation runtime for experiments. Please visit the
