          <p>TensorFlow Federated (TFF) is an open-source framework for machine learning and other
          computations on decentralized data. TFF has been developed to facilitate open research and
          experimentation with
          <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html" class="external">Federated Learning (FL)</a>,
          an approach to machine learning where a shared global model is trained across many
          participating clients that keep their training data locally. For example, FL has been used
          to train
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03604" class="external">prediction models for mobile keyboards</a>
          without uploading sensitive typing data to servers.</p>
          <p>TFF enables developers to simulate the included federated learning algorithms on their
          models and data, as well as to experiment with novel algorithms. The building blocks
          provided by TFF can also be used to implement non-learning computations, such as aggregated
          analytics over decentralized data. TFF’s interfaces are organized in two layers:</p>
      - heading: Federated Learning (FL) API
        description: >
          This layer offers a set of high-level interfaces that allow developers to apply the
          included implementations of federated training and evaluation to their existing
          TensorFlow models.

        description: >
          At the core of the system is a set of lower-level interfaces for concisely expressing
          novel federated algorithms by combining TensorFlow with distributed communication
          operators within a strongly-typed functional programming environment. This layer also
          serves as the foundation upon which we've built Federated Learning.

          TFF enables developers to declaratively express federated computations, so they could be
          deployed to diverse runtime environments. Included with TFF is a single-machine
          simulation runtime for experiments. Please visit the
          <a href="/federated/tutorials/federated_learning_for_image_classification">tutorials</a>
          and try it out yourself!
