Decorates/wraps Python functions and defuns as TFF TensorFlow computations.

```python
tff.tf_computation(*args)
```

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

This symbol can be used as either a decorator or a wrapper applied to a function
given to it as an argument. The supported patterns and examples of usage are as
follows:

1.  Convert an existing function inline into a TFF computation. This is the
    simplest mode of usage, and how one can embed existing non-TFF code for use
    with the TFF framework. In this mode, one invokes
    <a href="../tff/tf_computation.md"><code>tff.tf_computation</code></a> with
    a pair of arguments, the first being a function/defun that contains the
    logic, and the second being the TFF type of the parameter:

    ```python
    foo = tff.tf_computation(lambda x: x > 10, tf.int32)
    ```

    After executing the above code snippet, `foo` becomes an instance of the
    abstract base class `Computation`. Like all computations, it has the
    `type_signature` property:

    ```python
    str(foo.type_signature) == '(int32 -> bool)'
    ```

    The function passed as a parameter doesn't have to be a lambda, it can also
    be an existing Python function or a defun. Here's how to construct a
    computation from the standard TensorFlow operator `tf.add`:

    ```python
    foo = tff.tf_computation(tf.add, (tf.int32, tf.int32))
    ```

    The resulting type signature is as expected:

    ```python
    str(foo.type_signature) == '(<int32,int32> -> int32)'
    ```

    If one intends to create a computation that doesn't accept any arguments,
    the type argument is simply omitted. The function must be a no-argument
    function as well:

    ```python
    foo = tf_computation(lambda: tf.constant(10))
    ```

2.  Decorate a Python function or a TensorFlow defun with a TFF type to wrap it
    as a TFF computation. The only difference between this mode of usage and the
    one mentioned above is that instead of passing the function/defun as an
    argument,
    <a href="../tff/tf_computation.md"><code>tff.tf_computation</code></a> along
    with the optional type specifier is written above the function/defun's body.

    Here's an example of a computation that accepts a parameter:

    ```python
    @tff.tf_computation(tf.int32)
    def foo(x):
      return x > 10
    ```

    One can think of this mode of usage as merely a syntactic sugar for the
    example already given earlier:

    ```python
    foo = tff.tf_computation(lambda x: x > 10, tf.int32)
    ```

    Here's an example of a no-parameter computation:

    ```python
    @tff.tf_computation
    def foo():
      return tf.constant(10)
    ```

    Again, this is merely syntactic sugar for the example given earlier:

    ```python
    foo = tff.tf_computation(lambda: tf.constant(10))
    ```

    If the Python function has multiple decorators,
    <a href="../tff/tf_computation.md"><code>tff.tf_computation</code></a>
    should be the outermost one (the one that appears first in the sequence).

3.  Create a polymorphic callable to be instantiated based on arguments,
    similarly to TensorFlow defuns that have been defined without an input
    signature.

    This mode of usage is symmetric to those above. One simply omits the type
    specifier, and applies
    <a href="../tff/tf_computation.md"><code>tff.tf_computation</code></a> as a
    decorator or wrapper to a function/defun that does expect parameters.

    Here's an example of wrapping a lambda as a polymorphic callable:

    ```python
    foo = tff.tf_computation(lambda x, y: x > y)
    ```

    The resulting `foo` can be used in the same ways as if it were had the type
    been declared; the corresponding computation is simply created on demand, in
    the same way as how polymorphic TensorFlow defuns create and cache concrete
    function definitions for each combination of argument types.

    ```python
    ...foo(1, 2)...
    ...foo(0.5, 0.3)...
    ```

    Here's an example of creating a polymorphic callable via decorator:

    ```python
    @tff.tf_computation
    def foo(x, y):
      return x > y
    ```

    The syntax is symmetric to all examples already shown.

#### Args:

*   <b>`*args`</b>: Either a function/defun, or TFF type spec, or both (function
    first), or neither, as documented in the 3 patterns and examples of usage
    above.

#### Returns:

If invoked with a function as an argument, returns an instance of a TFF
computation constructed based on this function. If called without one, as in the
typical decorator style of usage, returns a callable that expects to be called
with the function definition supplied as a parameter; see the patterns and
examples of usage above.
