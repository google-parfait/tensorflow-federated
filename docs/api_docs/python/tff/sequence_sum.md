# tff.sequence_sum

```python
tff.sequence_sum(value)
```

Defined in
[`core/api/intrinsics.py`](http://github.com/tensorflow/federated/tree/master/tensorflow_federated/python/core/api/intrinsics.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Computes a sum of elements in a sequence.

#### Args:

*   <b>`value`</b>: A value of a TFF type that is either a sequence, or a
    federated sequence.

#### Returns:

The sum of elements in the sequence. If the argument `value` is of a federated
type, the result is also of a federated type, with the sum computed locally and
independently at each location (see also a discussion on `sequence_map` and
`sequence_reduce`).

#### Raises:

*   <b>`TypeError`</b>: If the arguments are of wrong or unsupported types.
