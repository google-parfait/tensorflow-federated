Applies `tf.identity` pointwise to `source`.

```python
tff.utils.identity(source)
```

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

This utility function provides the exact same behavior as `tf.identity`, but it
generalizes to a wider class of objects, including ordinary tensors, variables,
as well as various types of nested structures. It would typically be used
together with `tf.control_dependencies` in non-eager TensorFlow.

#### Args:

*   <b>`source`</b>: A nested structure composed of tensors or variables
    embedded in containers that are compatible with `tf.nest`, or instances of
    `anonymous_tuple.AnonymousTuple`. Elements that represent variables have
    their content extracted prior to identity mapping by first invoking
    `tf.Variable.read_value`.

#### Returns:

The result of applying `tf.identity` to read all elements of the `source`
pointwise, with the same structure as `source`.

#### Raises:

*   <b>`TypeError`</b>: If types mismatch.
