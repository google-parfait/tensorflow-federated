# tff.utils.identity

```python
tff.utils.identity(source)
```

Defined in
[`core/utils/tf_computation_utils.py`](http://github.com/tensorflow/federated/tree/master/tensorflow_federated/python/core/utils/tf_computation_utils.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Applies `tf.identity` pointwise to `source`.

This utility function provides the exact same behavior as `tf.identity`, but it
generalizes to a wider class of objects, including ordinary tensors, variables,
as well as various types of nested structures. It would typically be used
together with `tf.control_dependencies` in non-eager TensorFlow.

#### Args:

*   <b>`source`</b>: A nested structure composed of tensors or variables
    embedded in containers that are compatible with `tf.contrib.framework.nest`,
    or instances of `anonymous_tuple.AnonymousTuple`. Elements that represent
    variables have their content extracted prior to identity mapping by first
    invoking `tf.Variable.read_value`.

#### Returns:

The result of applying `tf.identity` to read all elements of the `source`
pointwise, with the same structure as `source`.

#### Raises:

*   <b>`TypeError`</b>: If types mismatch.
