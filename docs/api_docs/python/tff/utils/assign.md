# tff.utils.assign

```python
tff.utils.assign(
    target,
    source
)
```

Defined in
[`core/utils/tf_computation_utils.py`](http://github.com/tensorflow/federated/tree/master/tensorflow_federated/python/core/utils/tf_computation_utils.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Creates an op that assigns `target` from `source`.

This utility function provides the exact same behavior as `tf.assign`, but it
generalizes to a wider class of objects, including ordinary variables as well as
various types of nested structures.

#### Args:

*   <b>`target`</b>: A nested structure composed of variables embedded in
    containers that are compatible with `tf.contrib.framework.nest`, or
    instances of `anonymous_tuple.AnonymousTuple`.
*   <b>`source`</b>: A nsested structure composed of tensors, matching that of
    `target`.

#### Returns:

A single op that represents the assignment.

#### Raises:

*   <b>`TypeError`</b>: If types mismatch.
