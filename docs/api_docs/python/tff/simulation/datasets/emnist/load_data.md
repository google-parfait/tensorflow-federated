# tff.simulation.datasets.emnist.load_data

```python
tff.simulation.datasets.emnist.load_data(
    only_digits=True,
    cache_dir=None
)
```

Defined in
[`simulation/datasets/emnist/load_data.py`](http://github.com/tensorflow/federated/tree/master/tensorflow_federated/python/simulation/datasets/emnist/load_data.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Loads the Federated EMNIST dataset.

Downloads and caches the dataset locally. If previously downloaded, tries to
load the dataset from cache.

This dataset is derived from the Leaf repository
(https://github.com/TalwalkarLab/leaf) pre-processing of the Extended MNIST
dataset, grouping examples by writer. Details about Leaf were published in
"LEAF: A Benchmark for Federated Settings" https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01097.

Data set sizes:

*only_digits=True*: 3,383 users, 10 label classes

-   train: 341,873 examples
-   test: 40,832 examples

*only_digits=False*: 3,400 users, 62 label classes

-   train: 671,585 examples
-   test: 77,483 examples

Rather than holding out specific users, each user's examples are split across
_train_ and _test_ so that all users have at least one example in _train_ and
one example in _test_. Writers that had less than 2 examples are excluded from
the data set.

The `tf.data.Datasets` returned by
<a href="../../../../tff/simulation/ClientData.md#create_tf_dataset_for_client"><code>tff.simulation.ClientData.create_tf_dataset_for_client</code></a>
will yield `collections.OrderedDict` objects at each iteration, with the
following keys and values:

-   `'pixels'`: a `tf.Tensor` with `dtype=tf.float32` and shape [28, 28],
    containing the pixels of the handwritten digit.
-   `'label'`: a `tf.Tensor` with `dtype=tf.int32` and shape [1], the class
    label of the corresponding pixels.

#### Args:

*   <b>`only_digits`</b>: (Optional) whether to only include examples that are
    from the digits [0-9] classes. If `False`, includes lower and upper case
    characters, for a total of 62 class labels.
*   <b>`cache_dir`</b>: (Optional) directory to cache the downloaded file. If
    `None`, caches in Keras' default cache directory.

#### Returns:

Tuple of (train, test) where the tuple elements are
<a href="../../../../tff/simulation/ClientData.md"><code>tff.simulation.ClientData</code></a>
objects.
