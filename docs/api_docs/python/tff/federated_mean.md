Computes a <a href="../tff.md#SERVER"><code>tff.SERVER</code></a> mean of
`value` placed on <a href="../tff.md#CLIENTS"><code>tff.CLIENTS</code></a>.

```python
tff.federated_mean(
    value,
    weight=None
)
```

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

#### Args:

*   <b>`value`</b>: The value of which the mean is to be computed. Must be of a
    TFF federated type placed at
    <a href="../tff.md#CLIENTS"><code>tff.CLIENTS</code></a>. The value may be
    structured, e.g., its member constituents can be named tuples. The tensor
    types that the value is composed of must be floating-point or complex.
*   <b>`weight`</b>: An optional weight, a TFF federated integer or
    floating-point tensor value, also placed at
    <a href="../tff.md#CLIENTS"><code>tff.CLIENTS</code></a>.

#### Returns:

A representation at the <a href="../tff.md#SERVER"><code>tff.SERVER</code></a>
of the mean of the member constituents of `value`, optionally weighted with
`weight` if specified (otherwise, the member constituents contributed by all
clients are equally weighted).

#### Raises:

*   <b>`TypeError`</b>: if `value` is not a federated TFF value placed at
    <a href="../tff.md#CLIENTS"><code>tff.CLIENTS</code></a>, or if `weight` is
    not a federated integer or a floating-point tensor with the matching
    placement.
