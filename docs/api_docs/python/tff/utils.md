# Module: tff.utils

Defined in
[`core/utils/__init__.py`](http://github.com/tensorflow/federated/tree/master/tensorflow_federated/python/core/utils/__init__.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Utility classes/functions built on top of TensorFlow Federated Core API.

All components that depend on utils should import symbols from this file rather
than directly importing individual modules. For this reason, the visibility for
the latter is set to private and should remain such. The code in utils must not
depend on implementation classes. It should be written against the Core API.

## Classes

[`class IterativeProcess`](../tff/utils/IterativeProcess.md): A process that
includes an initialization and iterated computation.

[`class StatefulAggregateFn`](../tff/utils/StatefulAggregateFn.md): A simple
container for a stateful aggregation function.

[`class StatefulBroadcastFn`](../tff/utils/StatefulBroadcastFn.md): A simple
container for a stateful broadcast function.

## Functions

[`assign(...)`](../tff/utils/assign.md): Creates an op that assigns `target`
from `source`.

[`get_variables(...)`](../tff/utils/get_variables.md): Creates a set of
variables that matches the given `type_spec`.

[`identity(...)`](../tff/utils/identity.md): Applies `tf.identity` pointwise to
`source`.

[`update_state(...)`](../tff/utils/update_state.md): Returns a new `state` (a
namedtuple) with updated with kwargs.
