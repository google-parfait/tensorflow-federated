[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Changed

*   Updated `tensorflow` to version `2.16.1`.

## Release 0.81.0

### Added

    values explicitly.

### Changed

*   The format of the release notes (i.e., `RELEASE.md`) to be based on
    https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/.
*   Moved constraint on `linfinity_bound` from `DPGroupingFederatedSumFactory`
    to `DPGroupByFactory`, because closed-domain histogram algorithm will use
    `DPGroupingFederatedSum` but not demand a positive `linfinity_bound`.

    superseded by `tff.learning.algorithms.build_fed_eval`.

## Release 0.79.0

### Major Features and Improvements

    tests.

### Bug Fixes

*   Fixed #4588: Target Haswell CPU architectures (`-march=haswell`) instead of
    whatever is native to the build infrastructure to ensure that binaries in
    the pip package and executable on Colab CPU runtimes.

## Release 0.76.0

### Major Features and Improvements

*   Added a `Literal` to the TFF language, part 2. This change updates the
    tracing and execution portions of TFF to begin using the `Literal`.

    scalar types in addition to the numpy scalar types.
*   Added a `Literal` to the TFF language, part 1.

    usage

## Release 0.74.0

### Major Features and Improvements

*   Make some of the C++ executor APIs public visibility for downstream repos.
*   Moved the `DataType` protobuf object into its own module. Moving the
    `DataType` object into its own module allows `DataType` to be used outside
    of a `Computation` more easily and prevents a circular dependency between
    `Computation` and `Array` which both require a `DataType`.
*   Updated `build_apply_optimizer_finalizer` to allow custom reject update
    function.
*   Relaxed the type requirement of the attributes of `ModelWeights` to allow
    assigning list or tuples of matching values to other sequence types on
    `tf.keras.Model` instances.
*   Improved the errors raised by JAX computations for various types.
*   Updated tutorials to use recommended `tff.learning` APIs.

### Breaking Changes

*   Removed the runtime-agnostic support for `tf.RaggedTensor` and
    `tf.SparseTensor`.

## Release 0.73.0

### Major Features and Improvements

*   Make some of the C++ executor APIs public visibility for downstream repos.
*   `tff.learning.algorithms.build_fed_kmeans` supports floating point weights,
    enabling compatibility with `tff.aggregators` using differential privacy.

    `tff.learning.metrics.finalize_then_sample` and
    `tff.learning.metrics.FinalizeThenSampleFactory`.

### Breaking Changes

*   Remove the ability to return `SequenceType` from `tff.federated_computation`
    decorated callables.

### Bug Fixes

*   `tff.learning` algorithms now correctly do *not* include metrics for clients
    that had zero weight due to model updates containing non-finite values.
    Previously the update was rejected, but the metrics still aggregated.

## Release 0.72.0

### Major Features and Improvements

*   Added an async XLA runtime under `tff.backends.xla`.

### Breaking Changes

*   Updated `tensorflow-privacy` version to `0.9.0`.
*   Removed the deprecated `type_signature` parameter from the
    `tff.program.ReleaseManager.release` method.

## Release 0.71.0

### Major Features and Improvements

*   Added new environment-specific packages to TFF.

    `tff.federated_(min|max)` instead.

## Release 0.69.0

### Major Features and Improvements

    tff.learning.metrics.(secure_)sum_then_finalize is now optional (and is not
    actually used). It will be removed in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

*   tff.learning.metrics.(secure_)sum_then_finalize now return polymorphic
    computations. They can still be passed into algorithm builders (e.g.
    tff.learning.algorithms.build_weighted_fed_avg) but to be called directly
    they must first be traced with explicit types.
*   Removed support for handling `tf.TensorSpec` using `to_type`, use
    `tensorflow_to_type` instead.
*   Removed support for calling `tff.TensorType` using a `tf.dtypes.DType`.

## Release 0.68.0

### Major Features and Improvements

*   Added `tff.types.tensorflow_to_type` function to convert structures
    containing tensorflow type specs into a `tff.Type`.
*   Deprecated `tff.types.infer_unplaced_type`.
*   Updated `tff.types.ArrayShape` to be defined as a `Sequence` not an

    for comparison.
*   Deprecated the `type_signature` parameter for the
    `tff.program.ReleaseManager.release` method.

### Breaking Changes

*   Removed the implementation of `tff.Value.__add__`.

    `tff.FederatedType` constructor instead.
*   Removed support for handling `tf.data.DatasetSpec`, `tf.RaggedTensorSpec`,
    and `tf.SparseTensorSpec` using `tff.to_type`, use
    `tff.types.tensorflow_to_type` instead.
*   Removed support for handling `tf.RaggedTensor` and `tf.SparseTensor` using
    `infer_type`.

## Release 0.67.0

### Major Features and Improvements

*   Updated the representation of a tff.TensorType.dtype to be a `np.dtype`
    instead of `tf.dtypes.Dtype`.

    when using StreamingRemoteExecutor instead of returning an error about
    placement not found.

## Release 0.65.0

### Major Features and Improvements

*   Update the representation of a `tff.TensorType.shape` to be a
    `tff.types.ArrayShape` instead of `tf.TensorShape`.

*   Updated `type_to_py_container``to be able to handle`tff.SequenceTypes` with
    an unknown Python type.

### Breaking Changes

*   Moved `tff.structure_from_tensor_type_tree` to
    `tff.types.structure_from_tensor_type_tree`.

## Release 0.15.0

### Major Features and Improvements

*   Updated `tensorflow-addons` package dependency to `0.9.0`.
*   Added API to expose the native backend more conveniently. See
    `tff.backends.native.*` for more information.
*   Added a compiler argument to the `tff.framework.ExecutionContext` API and
    provided a compiler for the native execution environment, which improves
    TFF’s default concurrency pattern.
*   Introduced a new `tff.templates.MeasuredProcess` concept, a specialization
    of `tff.templates.IterativeProcess`.
*   Extends `tff.learning` interfaces to accept `tff.templates.MeasuredProcess`
    objects for aggregation and broadcast computations.
*   Introduce new convenience method `tff.learning.weights_type_from_model`.

    implementation of a specific intrinsic is easier to provide.
*   Reduced duplication in TFF’s generated ASTs.
*   Enabled usage of GPUs on remote workers.
*   Documentation improvements.

### Breaking Changes

*   The `IterativeProcess` return from
    `tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process` and
    `tff.learning.build_federated_sgd_process` now zip the second tuple output
    (the metrics) to change the result from a structure of federated values to
    to a federated structure of values.
*   Removed `tff.framework.set_default_executor` function, instead you should
    use the more convenient `tff.backends.native.set_local_execution_context`
    function or manually construct a context an set it using
    `tff.framework.set_default_context`.
*   The `tff.Computation` base class now contains an abstract `__hash__` method,
    to ensure compilation results can be cached. Any custom implementations of
    this interface should be updated accordingly.

    added to any collections.
*   Fixed issue where table initializers were not run if the
    `tff.tf_computation` decorated function used no variables.

    deserializing datasets with GPU-backed runtime.

    over GPU device boundaries, which fails by default. This can be hit by
    certain usages of TFF,
    [e.g. as tracked here](https://github.com/tensorflow/federated/issues/832).
