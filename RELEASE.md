# Release 0.14.0

## Major Features and Improvements

*   Multiple TFF execution speedups.
*   New `tff.templates.MeasuredProcess` specialization of `IterativeProcess`.
*   Increased optimization of the `tff.templates.IterativeProcess` ->
    `tff.backends.mapreduce.CanonicalForm` compiler.

## Breaking Changes

*   Moved `tff.utils.IterativeProcess` to `tff.templates.IterativeProcess`.
*   Removed `tff.learning.TrainableModel`, client optimizers are now arguments
    on the `tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process`.
*   Bump required version of pip packages for tensorflow (2.2), numpy (1.18),
    pandas (0.24), grpcio (1.29).

## Bug Fixes

*   Issue with GPUs in multimachine simulations not being utilized, and bug on
    deserializing datasets with GPU-backed runtime.
*   TensorFlow lookup table initialization failures.

## Known Bugs

*   In some situations, TF will attempt to push Datasets inside of tf.functions
    over GPU device boundaries, which fails by default. This can be hit by
    certain usages of TFF,
    [e.g. as tracked here](https://github.com/tensorflow/federated/issues/832).

    named types. `tff.learning.ModelWeights` no longer names the tuple fields
    returned for model weights, instead relying on an ordered list.

    high-performance executor stack.

    the new execution stack.
