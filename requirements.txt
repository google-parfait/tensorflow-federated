# Requirements for the TensorFlow Federated development environment.
#
# If you add a dependency here and it is required by the TensorFlow Federated
# package, also add the dependency to
# https://github.com/tensorflow/federated/blob/main/tensorflow_federated/tools/development/setup.py.
#
# The version of a dependency should match the version in
# https://github.com/tensorflow/federated/blob/main/tensorflow_federated/tools/development/setup.py.
#
# *   For packages that have a stable release, we use a version that is
#     compatible with that release (e.g. `~=x.y`). See
#     https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#compatible-release for more information.
# *   For packages that do not have a stable release, we use a version that
#     matches a release that has been tested (e.g. `==x.y.z`). See
#     https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#version-matching for more information.
#
# This assumes that the packages follows Semantic Versioning, see
# https://semver.org/. If a package follows a different versioning scheme or
# requires unique handling, we use a different version specifier and comment the
# versioning scheme or reasoning.
